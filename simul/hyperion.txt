1	PROLOGUE
2	
3	The Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played
4	Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but
5	well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and
6	bellowed in the swamps below. A thunderstorm was brewing to the north.
7	Bruise-black clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms while
8	stratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky. Lightning
9	rippled along the horizon. Closer to the ship, occasional vague,
10	reptilian shapes would blunder into the interdiction field, cry out, and
11	then crash away through indigo mists. The Consul concentrated on a
12	difficult section of the Prelude and ignored the approach of storm and
13	nightfall.
14	The fatline receiver chimed.
15	The Consul stopped, fingers hovering above the keyboard, and listened.
16	Thunder rumbled through the heavy air. From the direction of the
17	gymnosperm forest there came the mournful ululation of a carrion-breed
18	pack. Somewhere in the darkness below, a small-brained beast trumpeted
19	its answering challenge and fell quiet.
20	The interdiction field added its sonic undertones to the sudden silence.
21	The fatline chimed again.
22	'Damn,' said the Consul and went in to answer it.
23	While the computer took a few seconds to convert and decode the burst of
24	decaying tachyons, the Consul poured himself a glass of Scotch. He
25	settled into the cushions of the projection pit just as the diskey
26	blinked green. 'Play,' he said.
27	'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion,' came a woman's husky
28	voice. Full visuals had not yet formed; the air remained empty except
29	for the pulse of transmission
30	codes which told the Consul that this fatline squirt had originated on
31	the Hegemony administrative world of Tau Ceti Center. The Consul did
32	not need the transmission coordinates to know this. The aged but still
33	beautiful voice of Meina Gladstone was unmistakable.
34	'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion as a member of the Shrike
35	Pilgrimage,' continued the voice.
36	The hell you say, thought the Consul and rose to leave the pit.
37	'You and six others have been selected by the Church of the Shrike and
38	confirmed by the All Thing,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is in the
39	interest of the Hegemony that you accept."
40	The Consul stood motionless in the pit, his back to the flickering
41	transmission codes. Without turning, he raised his glass and drained
42	the last of the Scotch.
43	'The situation is very confused,' said Meina Gladstone. Her voice was
44	weary. 'The consulate and Home Rule Council fatlined us three standard
45	weeks ago with the news that the Time Tombs showed signs of opening. The
46	anti-entropic fields around them were expanding rapidly and the Shrike
47	has begun ranging as far south as the Bridle Range."
48	The Consul turned and dropped into the cushions. A hoio had formed of
49	Meina Gladstone's ancient face. Her eyes looked as tired as her voice
50	sounded.
51	'A FORCE:space task force was immediately dispatched from Parvati to
52	evacuate the Hegemony citizens on Hyperion before the Time Tombs open.
53	Their time-debt will be a little more than three Hyperion years." Meina
54	Gladstone paused. The Consul thought he had never seen the Senate CEO
55	look so grim. 'We do not know if the evacuation fleet will arrive in
56	time,' she said, 'but the situation is even more complicated. An Ouster
57	migration cluster of at least four thousand... units...
58	has been detected approaching the Hyperion system.
59	Our evacuation task force should arrive only a short while before the
60	Ousters."
61	The Consul understood Gladstone's hesitation. An Ouster migration
62	cluster might consist of ships ranging in size from single-person
63	ramscouts to can cities and comet forts holding tens of thousands of the
64	interstellar barbarians.
65	'The FORCE joint chiefs believe that this is the Ousters' big push,'
66	said Meina Gladstone. The ship's computer had positioned the holo so
67	that the woman's sad brown eyes seemed to be staring directly at the
68	Consul.
69	'Whether they seek to control just Hyperion for the Time Tombs or
70	whether this is an all-out attack on the Worldweb remains to be seen. In
71	the meantime, a full FORCE:space battle fleet complete with a fareaster
72	construction battalion has spun up from the Camn System to join the
73	evacuation task force, but this fleet may be recalled depending upon
74	circumstances."
75	The Consul nodded and absently raised the Scotch to his lips. He
76	frowned at the empty glass and dropped it onto the thick carpeting of
77	the holopit. Even with no military training he understood the difficult
78	tactical decision Gladstone and the joint chiefs were faced with.
79	Unless a military fareaster were hurriedly constructed in the Hyperion
80	system- at staggering expense- there would be no way to resist the
81	Ouster invasion. Whatever secrets the Time Tombs might hold would go to
82	the Hegemony's enemy. If the fleet did construct a farcaster in time
83	and the Hegemony committed the total resources of FORCE to defending the
84	single, distant, colonial world of Hyperion, the Worldweb ran the
85	terrible risk of suffering an Ouster attack elsewhere on the perimeter,
86	or- in a worst-case scenario- having the barbarians actually seizing the
87	farcaster and penetrating the Web itself. The Consul tried to imagine
88	the reality of armored Ouster troops stepping through farcaster portals
89	into the undefended home cities on a hundred worlds.
90	The Consul walked through the holo of Meina Gladstone, retrieved his
91	glass, and went to pour another Scotch.
92	'You have been chosen to join the pilgrimage to the Shrike,' said the
93	image of the old CEO whom the press loved to compare to Lincoln or
94	Churchill or Alvarez-Temp or whatever other pre-Hegira legend was in
95	historical vogue at the time. 'The Templars are sending their treeship
96	Yggdrasil!,' said Gladstone, 'and the
97	evacuation task force commander has instructions to let it pass. With a
98	three-week time-debt, you can rendezvous with the Yggdrasill before it
99	goes quantum from the Parvati system. The six other pilgrims chosen by
100	the Shrike Church will be aboard the treeship. Our intelligence reports
101	suggest that at least one of the seven pilgrims is an agent of the
102	Ousters. We do not... at this time... have any way of knowing which
103	one it is."
104	The Consul had to smile. Among all the other risks Gladstone was
105	taking, the old woman had to consider the possibility that he was the
106	spy and that she was fatlining crucial information to an Ouster agent.
107	Or had she given him any crucial information? The fleet movements were
108	detectable as soon as the ships used their Hawking drives, and if the
109	Consul were the spy, the CEO's revelation might be a way to scare him
110	off. The Consul's smile faded and he drank his Scotch.
111	'Sol Weintraub and Fedmahn Kassad are among the seven pilgrims chosen,'
112	said Gladstone.
113	The Consul's frown deepened. He stared at the cloud of digits
114	flickering like dust motes around the old woman's image. Fifteen
115	seconds of fatline transmission time remained.
116	'We need your help,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is essential that the
117	secrets of the Time Tombs and Shrike be uncovered. This pilgrimage may
118	be our last chance. If the Ousters conquer Hyperion, their agent must
119	be eliminated and the Time Tombs sealed at all cost. The fate of the
120	Hegemony may depend upon it."
121	The transmission ended except for the pulse of rendezvous coordinates.
122	'Response?" asked the ship's computer.
123	Despite the tremendous energies involved, the spacecraft was capable of
124	placing a brief, coded squirt into the incessant babble of FTL bursts
125	which tied the human portions of the galaxy together.
126	'No,' said the Consul and went outside to lean on the balcony railing.
127	Night had fallen and the clouds were low. No stars were visible. The
128	darkness would have been absolute except for the intermittent flash of
129	lightning to the north and a soft phosphorescence rising from the
130	marshes. The Consul was suddenly very aware that he was, at that
131	second, the only sentient being on an unnamed world. He listened to the
132	antediluvian night sounds rising from the swamps and he thought about
133	morning, about setting out in the Vikken EMV at first light, about
134	spending the day in sunshine, about hunting big game in the fern forests
135	to the south and then returning to the ship in the evening for a good
136	steak and a cold beer. The Consul thought about the sharp pleasure of
137	the hunt and the equally sharp solace of solitude: solitude he had
138	earned through the pain and nightmare he had
139	already suffered on Hyperion.
140	Hyperion.
141	The Consul went inside, brought the balcony in, and sealed the ship just
142	as the first heavy raindrops began to fall. He climbed the spiral
143	staircase to his sleeping cabin at the apex of the ship. The circular
144	room was dark except for silent explosions of lightning which outlined
145	rivulets of rain coursing the skylight. The Consul stripped, lay back
146	on the firm mattress, and switched on the sound system and external
147	audio pickups. He listened as the fury of the storm blended with the
148	violence of Wagner's 'Flight of the Valkyries." Hurricane winds buffeted
149	the ship. The sound of thunderclaps filled the room as the skylight
150	flashed white, leaving afterimages burning in the Consul's retinas.
151	Wagner is good only for thunderstorms, he thought.
152	He closed his eyes but the lightning was visible through closed eyelids.
153	He remembered the glint of ice crystals blowing through the tumbled
154	ruins on the low hills near the Time Tombs and the colder gleam of steel
155	on the Shrike's impossible tree of metal thorns. He remembered screams
156	in the night and the hundred-facet, ruby and-blood gaze of the Shrike
157	itself.
158	Hyperion.
159	The Consul silently commanded the computer to shut off all speakers and
160	raised his wrist to cover his eyes. In the sudden silence he lay
161	thinking about how insane it would be to return to Hyperion. During his
162	eleven years as Consul on that distant and enigmatic world, the
163	mysterious Church of the Shrike had allowed a dozen barges of offworld
164	pilgrims to depart for the windswept barrens
165	around the Time Tombs, north of the mountains. No one had returned. And
166	that had been in normal times, when the Shrike had been prisoner to the
167	tides of time and forces no one understood, and the anti-entropic fields
168	had been contained to a few dozen meters around the Time Tombs. And
169	there had been no threat of an Ouster invasion.
170	The Consul thought of the Shrike, free to wander everywhere on Hyperion,
171	of the millions of indigenies and thousands of Hegemony citizens
172	helpless before a creature which defied physical laws and which
173	communicated only through death, and he shivered despite the
174	warmth of the cabin.
175	Hyperion.
176	The night and storm passed. Another stormfront raced ahead of the
177	approaching dawn. Gymnosperms two hundred meters tall bent and whipped
178	before the coming torrent. Just before first light, the Consul's ebony
179	spaceship rose on a tail of blue plasma and punched through thickening
180	clouds as it climbed toward space and rendezvous.
181	ONE
182	The Consul awoke with the peculiar headache, dry throat, and sense of
183	having forgotten a thousand dreams which only periods in cryogenic fugue
184	could bring. He blinked, sat upright on a low couch, and groggily
185	pushed away the last sensor tapes clinging to his skin. There were two
186	very short crew clones and one very tall, hooded Templar with him in the
187	windowless ovoid of a room. One of the clones offered the Consul the
188	traditional post-thaw glass of orange juice. He accepted it and drank
189	greedily.
190	'The Tree is two light-minutes and five hours of travel from Hyperion,'
191	said the Templar, and the Consul realized that he was being addressed by
192	Het Masteen, captain of the Templar treeship and True Voice of the Tree.
193	The Consul vaguely realized that it was a great honor to be awakened by
194	the Captain, but he was too groggy and disoriented from fugue to
195	appreciate it.
196	'The others have been awake for some hours,' said Het Masteen and
197	gestured for the clones to leave them.
198	'They have assembled on the foremost dining platform."
199	'Hhrghn,' said the Consul and took a drink. He cleared his throat and
200	tried again. 'Thank you, Het Masteen,' he managed. Looking around at
201	the egg-shaped room with its carpet of dark grass, translucent walls,
202	and support ribs of continuous, curved weirwood, the Consul realized
203	that he must be in one of the smaller environment pods. Closing his
204	eyes, he tried to recall his memories of rendezvous just before the
205	Templar ship went quantum.
206	The Consul remembered his first glimpse of the kilometer-long treeship
207	as he closed for rendezvous, the treeship's details blurred by the
208	redundant machine and
209	erg-generated containment fields which surrounded it like a spherical
210	mist, but its leafy bulk clearly ablaze with thousands of lights which
211	shone softly through leaves and thin-walled environment pods, or along
212	countless platforms, bridges, command decks, stairways, and bowers.
213	Around the base of the treeship, engineering and cargo spheres clustered
214	like oversized galls while blue and violet drive streamers trailed
215	behind like ten-kilometer-long roots.
216	'The others await,' Her Masteen said softly and nodded toward low
217	cushions where the Consul's luggage lay ready to open upon his command.
218	The Templar gazed thoughtfully at the weirwood rafters while the Consul
219	dressed in semiformal evening wear of loose black trousers, polished
220	ship boots, a white silk blouse which ballooned at waist and elbows,
221	topaz collar cinch, black demi-coat complete with slashes of Hegemony
222	crimson on the epaulets, and a soft gold tricorne. A section of curved
223	wall became a mirror and the Consul stared at the image there: a more
224	than middle-aged man in semi-formal evening wear, sunburned skin but
225	oddly pale under the sad eyes. The Consul frowned, nodded, and turned
226	away.
227	Het Masteen gestured and the Consul followed the tall, robed figure
228	through a dilation in the pod onto an ascending walkway which curved up
229	and out of sight around the massive bark wall of the treeship's trunk.
230	The Consul paused, moved to the edge of the walkway, and took a quick
231	step back. It was at least six hundred meters down- down being created
232	by the one-sixth standard gravity being generated by the singularities
233	imprisoned at the base of the tree - and there were no railings.
234	They resumed their silent ascent, turning off from the main trunk
235	walkway thirty meters and half a trunk-spiral later to cross a flimsy
236	suspension bridge to a five-meter-wide branch. They followed this
237	outward to where the riot of leaves caught the glare of Hyperion's sun.
238	'Has my ship been brought out of storage?" asked the Consul.
239	'It is fueled and ready in sphere eleven,' said Her Masteen. They
240	passed into the shadow of the trunk and stars became visible in the
241	black patches between the dark latticework of leaves. 'The other
242	pilgrims have agreed to ferry down in your ship if the FORCE authorities
243	give permission,' added the Templar.
244	The Consul rubbed his eyes and wished that he had been allowed more time
245	to retrieve his wits from the cold grip of cryonic fugue. 'You've been
246	in touch with the task force?"
247	'Oh, yes, we were challenged the moment we tunneled down from quantum
248	leap. A Hegemony warship is...
249	escorting us.. · this very moment." Het Masteen gestured toward a patch
250	of sky above them.
251	The Consul squinted upward but at that second segments of the upper
252	tiers of branches revolved out of the treeship's shadow and acres of
253	leaves ignited in sunset hues. Even in the still shadowed places,
254	glowbirds nestled like Japanese lanterns above lighted walkways, glowing
255	swingvines, and illuminated hanging bridges, while fireflies from Old
256	Earth and radiant gossamers from Maul-Covenant blinked and coded their
257	way through labyrinths of leaves, mixing with constellations
258	sufficiently to fool even the most starwise traveler.
259	Het Masteen stepped into a basket lift hanging from a whiskered-carbon
260	cable which disappeared into the three hundred meters of tree above
261	them. The Consul followed and they were borne silently upward. He
262	noted that the walkways, pods, and platforms were conspicuously empty
263	except for a few Templars and their diminutive crew clone counterparts.
264	The Consul could recall seeing no other passengers during his rushed
265	hour between rendezvous and fugue, but he had put that down to the
266	imminence of the treeship going quantum, assuming then that the
267	passengers were safe in their fugue couches. Now, however, the treeship
268	was traveling far below relativistic velocities and its branches should
269	be crowded with gawking passengers. He mentioned his observation to the
270	Templar.
271	'The six of you are our only passengers,' said Het Masteen. The basket
272	stopped in a maze of foliage and
273	the treeship captain led the way up a wooden escalator worn with age.
274	The Consul blinked in surprise. A Templar treeship normally carried
275	between two and five thousand passengers; it was easily the most
276	desirable way to travel between the stars. Treeships rarely accrued
277	more than a four- or five-month time-debt, making short, scenic
278	crossings where star systems were a very few light-years apart, thus
279	allowing their affluent passengers to spend as little time as necessary
280	in fugue. For the treeship to make the trip to Hyperion and back,
281	accumulating six years of Web time with no paying passengers would mean
282	a staggering financial loss to the Templars.
283	Then the Consul realized, belatedly, that the treeship would be ideal
284	for the upcoming evacuation, its expenses ultimately to be reimbursed by
285	the Hegemony.
286	Still, the Consul knew, to bring a ship as beautiful and vulnerable as
287	the Yggdrasill - one of only five of its kind - into a war zone was a
288	terrible risk for the Templar Brotherhood.
289	'Your fellow pilgrims,' announced Het Masteen as he and the Consul
290	emerged onto a broad platform where a small group waited at one end of a
291	long wooden table.
292	Above them the stars burned, rotating occasionally as the treeship
293	changed its pitch or yaw, while to either side a solid sphere of foliage
294	curved away like the green skin of some great fruit. The Consul
295	immediately recognized the setting as the Captain's dining platform,
296	even before the five other passengers rose to let Her Masteen take his
297	place at the head of the table. The Consul found an empty chair waiting
298	for him to the left of the Captain.
299	When everyone was seated and quiet, Het Masteen made formal
300	introductions. Although the Consul knew none of the others from
301	personal experience, several of the names were familiar and he used his
302	diplomat's long training to file away identities and impressions.
303	To the Consul's left sat Father Lenar Hoyt, a priest of the old-style
304	Christian sect known as Catholic. For a second the Consul had forgotten
305	the significance of the black clothing and Roman collar, but then he
306	remembered St Francis Hospital on Hebron where he had
307	received alcohol trauma therapy after his disastrous first diplomatic
308	assignment there almost four standard decades earlier. And at the
309	mention of Hoyt's name he remembered another priest, one who had
310	disappeared on Hyperion halfway through his own tenure there.
311	Lenar Hoyt was a young man by the Consul's reckoning - no more than his
312	early thirties - but it appeared that something had aged the man
313	terribly in the not too distant past. The Consul looked at the thin
314	face, cheekbones pressing against sallow flesh, eyes large but hooded in
315	deep hollows, thin lips set in a permanent twitch of muscle too
316	downturned to be called even a cynical smile, the hairline not so much
317	receding as ravaged by radiation, and he felt he was looking at a man
318	who had been ill for years. Still, the Consul was surprised that behind
319	that mask of concealed pain there remained the physical echo of the boy
320	in the man - the faintest remnants of the round face, fair skin, and
321	soft mouth which had belonged to a younger, healthier, less cynical
322	Lenar Hoyt.
323	Next to the priest sat a man whose image had been familiar to most
324	citizens of the Hegemony some years before. The Consul wondered if the
325	collective attention span in the Worldweb was as short now as it had
326	been when he had lived there. Shorter, probably. If so, then Colonel
327	Fedmahn Kassad, the so-called Butcher of South Bressia, was probably no
328	longer either infamous or famous. To the Consul's generation and to all
329	those who lived in the slow, expatriate fringe of things, Kassad was not
330	someone one was likely to forget.
331	Colonel Fedmahn Kassad was tall- almost tall enough to look the
332	two-meter Her Masteen in the eye - and dressed in FORCE black with no
333	rank insignia or citations showing. The black uniform was oddly similar
334	to Father Hoyt's garb, but there was no real resemblance between the two
335	men. In lieu of Hoyt's wasted appearance, Kassad was brown, obviously
336	fit, and whip-handle lean, with strands of muscle showing in shoulder,
337	wrist, and throat. The Colonel's eyes were small, dark, and as
338	all-encompassing as the lenses of some primitive video camera. His face
339	was all angles: shadows, planes, and facets. Not gaunt like Father
340	Hoyt's, merely carved from cold stone. A thin line of beard along his
341	jawline served to accent the sharpness of his countenance as surely as
342	blood on a knife blade.
343	The Colonel's intense, slow movements reminded the Consul of an
344	Earth-bred jaguar he had seen in a private seedship zoo on Lusus many
345	years before. Kassad's voice was soft but the Consul did not fail to
346	notice that even the Colonel's silences commanded attention.
347	Most of the long table was empty, the group clustered at one end. Across
348	from Fedmahn Kassad sat a man introduced as the poet Martin Silenus.
349	Silenus appeared to be quite the opposite of the military *****man
350	across from him. Where Kassad was lean and tall, Martin Silenus was
351	short and visibly out of shape.
352	Countering Kassad's stone-cut features, the poet's face was as mobile
353	and expressive as an Earth primate's. His voice was a loud, profane
354	rasp. There was something, thought the Consul, almost pleasantly
355	demonic about Martin Silenus, with his ruddy cheeks, broad mouth,
356	pitched eyebrows, sharp ears, and constantly moving hands sporting
357	fingers long enough to serve a concert pianist.
358	Or a strangler. The poet' s silver hair had been cropped into
359	rough-hewn bangs.
360	Martin Silenus seemed to be in his late fifties, but the Consul noticed
361	the telltale blue tinge to throat and palms and suspected that the man
362	had been through more than a few Poulsen treatments. Silenus's true age
363	might be anywhere from ninetytoa hundred and fiftystandard years. I f
364	he were close to the latter age, the Consul knew, the odds were that the
365	poet was quite mad.
366	As boisterous and animated as Martin Silenus seemed upon first
367	encounter, so the next guest at the table exuded an immediate and
368	equally impressive sense of intelligent reticence. Sol Weintranb looked
369	up upon introduction and the Consul noted the short gray beard, lined
370	forehead, and sad, luminous eyes of the weli-known scholar. The Consul
371	had heard tales of the Wandering Jew and his hopeless quest, but he was
372	shocked to realize that the old man now held the infant in his arms -
373	his daughter Rachel, no more than a few weeks old. The Consul looked
374	away.
375	The sixth pilgrim and only woman at the table was Brawne Lamia. When
376	introduced, the detective stared at the Consul with such intensity that
377	he could feel the pressure of her gaze even after she looked away.
378	A former citizen of the I.3-g world of Lusus, Brawne Lamia was no taller
379	than the poet two chairs to her right, but even her loose corduroy
380	shipsuit did not conceal the heavy layers of muscle on her compact form.
381	Black curls reached to her shoulders, her eyebrows were two dark lines
382	dabbed horizontally across a wide brow, and her nose was solid and
383	sharp, intensifying the aquiline quality of her stare. Lamia's mouth
384	was wide and expressive to the point of being sensuous, curled slightly
385	at the coruers in a slight smile which might be cruel or merely playful.
386	The woman's dark eyes seemed to dare the observer to discover which was
387	the case.
388	It occurred to the Consul that Brawne Lamia might well be considered
389	beautiful.
390	Introductions completed, the Consul cleared his throat and turned toward
391	the Templar. 'Het Masteen, you said that there were seven pilgrims. Is
392	M.
393	Weintraub's child the seventh?"
394	Het Masteen's hood moved slowly from side to side.
395	'No. Only those who make a conscious decision to seek the Shrike may be
396	counted among the pilgrims."
397	The group at the table stirred slightly. Each must know what the Consul
398	knew; only a group comprising a prime number of pilgrims might make the
399	Shrike Church-sponsored trip north.
400	'I am the seventh,' said Het Masteen, captain of the Templar treeship
401	ggdrasill and the True Voice of the Tree. In the silence which followed
402	the announcement, Her Masteen gestured and a group of crew clones began
403	serving the pilgrims their last meal before planetfall.
404	'So the Ousters are not in-system yet?" asked Brawne Lamia. Her voice
405	had a husky, throaty quality which strangely stirred the Consul.
406	'No,' said Het Masteen. 'But we cannot be more than a few standard days
407	ahead of them. Our instruments
408	have detected fusion skirmishes within the system's OOrt cloud."
409	'Will there be war."?" asked Father Hoyt. His voice seemed as fatigued
410	as his expression. When no one volunteered a response, the priest
411	turned to his right as if retroactively directing the question to the
412	Consul.
413	The Consul sighed. The crew clones had served wine; he wished it had
414	been whiskey. 'Who knows what the Ousters will do?" he said. 'They no
415	longer appear to be motivated by human logic."
416	Martin Silenus laughed loudly, spilling his wine as he gestured. 'As if
417	we fucking humans were ever motivated by human logic!" He took a deep
418	drink, wiped his mouth, and laughed again.
419	Brawne Lamia frowned. 'If the serious fighting starts too soon,' she
420	said, 'perhaps the authorities will not allow us to land."
421	'We will be allowed to pass,; said Her Masteen. Sunlight found its way
422	past folds in his cowl to fall on yellowish skin.
423	'Saved from certain death in war to be delivered to certain death at the
424	hands of the Shrike,' murmured Father Hoyt.
425	'There is no death in all the Universe!" intoned Martin Silenus in a
426	voice which the Consul felt sure could have awakened someone deep in
427	cryogenic fugue. The poet drained the last of his wine and' raised the
428	empty goblet in an apparent toast to the stars:
429	'No smellof death = there shall be no death, moan, moan; Moan, Cybele,
430	moan;for t hy pernicious Babes
431	Have changed a god into a shaking palsy.
432	Moan, brethren, moan, for l have no strength left;
433	Freak as the reed - weak - feeble as my voice- Oh, oh, thepain, thepain
434	of feebleness.
435	Moan, moan, for still l thaw..."
436	.Silenus abruptly broke off and poured more wine, belching once into
437	the silence which had followed his recitation.
438	The other six looked at one another. The Consul noticed that Sol
439	Weintraub was smiling slightly until the baby in his arms stirred and
440	distracted him.
441	'Well,' said Father Hoyt hesitantly, as if trying to retrieve an earlier
442	strand of thought, 'if the Hegemony convoy leaves and the Ousters take
443	Hyperion, perhaps the occupation will be bloodless and they'll let us go
444	about our business."
445	Colonel Fedmahn Kassad laughed softly. 'The Ousters don't want to
446	occupy Hyperion,' he said. 'If they take the planet they'll loot what
447	they want and then do what they do best. They'll burn the cities into
448	charred rubble, break the rubble into smaller' pieces, and then bake the
449	pieces until they glow. They'll melt the poles, boil the oceans, and
450	then use the residue to salt what's left of the continents so nothing
451	will ever grow there again."
452	'Well..." began Father Hoyt and then trailed off.
453	There was no conversation as the clones cleared the soup and salad
454	dishes and brought on the main course.
455	'You said that there was a Hegemony warship escorting us,' the Consul
456	said to Het Masteen as they finished their roast beef and boiled sky
457	squid.
458	The Templar nodded and pointed. The Consul squinted but could make out
459	nothing moving against the rotating starfield.
460	'Here,' said Fedmahn Kassad and leaned across Father Hoyt to hand the
461	Consul a collapsible pair of military binoculars.
462	The Consul nodded his thanks, thumbed on the power, and scanned the
463	patch of sky Het Masteen had indicated. Gyroscopic crystals in the
464	binoculars hummed slightly as they stabilized the optics and swept the
465	area in a programmed search pattern. Suddenly the image froze, blurred,
466	expanded, and steadied.
467	The Consul c6uld not avoid an involuntary intake of breath as the
468	Hegemony ship filled the viewer. Neither the expected field-blurred
469	seed of a solo ramscout nor the bulb of a torchship, the electronically
470	outlined image was of a matte-black attack carrier. The thing was
471	impressive in the way only warships through the centuries had succeeded
472	in being. The Hegemony spinship was incongruously streamlined with its
473	four
474	sets of boom arms retracted in battle readiness, its sixty-meter command
475	probe sharp as a Clovis point, and its Hawking drive and fusion blisters
476	set far back along the launch shaft like feathers on an arrow.
477	The Consul handed the binoculars back to Kassad without comment. If the
478	task force was using a full attack carrier to escort the Yggdrasili,
479	what kind of firepower were they setting in place to meet the Ouster
480	invasion?
481	'How long until we land?" askedBrawne Lamia. She had been using her
482	cornlog to access the treeship's datasphere and obviously was frustrated
483	with what she had found. Or had not found.
484	'Four hours until orbit,' murmured Het Masteen. 'A few minutes more by
485	dropship. Our consular friend has offered his private craft to ferry
486	you down."
487	'To Keats?" said Sol Weintraub. It was the first time the scholar had
488	spoken since dinner had been served.
489	The Consul nodded. 'It's still the only spaceport on Hyperion set to
490	handle passenger vehicles,' he said.
491	'Spaceport?" Father Hoyt sounded angry. 'I thought that we were going
492	straight to the north. To the Shrike's realm."
493	Het Mssteen patiently shook his head. 'The pilgrimage always begins
494	from the capital,' he said. 'It will take several days to reach the
495	Time Tombs."
496	'Several days,' snapped Brawne Lamia. 'That's absurd."
497	'Perhaps,' agreed Het Mssteen, 'but it is the case, nonetheless."
498	Father Hoyt looked as if something in the meal had caused him
499	indigestion even though he had eaten almost nothing. 'Look,' he said,
500	'couldn't we change the rules this once - I mean, given the war scare
501	and all? And just land near the Time Tombs or wherever and get it over
502	with?"
503	The Consul shook his head. 'Spacecraft and aircraft have been trying to
504	take the short route to the northern moors for almost four hundred
505	years,' he said. 'l know of none who made it."
506	'May one inquire,' said Martin Silenus, happily raising his hand like a
507	schoolboy, 'just what the gibbering fuck happens to these legions of
508	ships?"
509	Father Hoyt frowned at the poet. Fedmahn Kassad smiled slightly. Sol
510	Weintraub said, 'The Consul did not mean to suggest that the area is
511	inaccessible. One may travel by ship or various land routes. Nor do
512	spacecraft and aircraft disappear. They easily land near the ruins or
513	the Time Tombs and just as easily return to whatever point their
514	computers command. It is merely the pilots and passengers who are never
515	seen again." Weintraub lifted the sleeping baby from his lap and set her
516	in an infant carrier slung around his neck.
517	'So the tired old legend goes,' said Brawne Lamia.
518	'What do the ship logs show?"
519	'Nothing,' said the Consul. 'No violence. No forced entry. No
520	deviation from course. No unexplained time lapses. No unusual energy
521	emissions or depletions. No physical phenomena of any sort."
522	'No passengers,' said Het Masteen.
523	The Consul did a slow double take. If Het Masteen had, indeed, just
524	attempted a joke, it was the first sign in all of the Consul's decades
525	of dealing with the Templars that one of them had shown even a nascent
526	sense of humour. What the Consul could see of the Captain's vaguely
527	oriental features beneath the cowl gave no hint that a joke had been
528	attempted.
529	'Marvelous melodrama,' laughed Silenus. 'A real-life, Christ-weeping
530	Sargasso of Souls and we're for it.
531	Who orchestrates this shitpot of a plot, anyway?"
532	'Shut up,' said Brawne Lamia. 'You're drunk, old man."
533	The Consul sighed. The group had been together for less than a standard
534	hour.
535	Crew clones swept away the dishes and brought dessert trays showcasing
536	sherbets, coffees, treeship fruit, draums, tortes, and concoctions made
537	of Renaissance chocolate. Martin Silenus waved away the desserts and
538	told the clones to bring him another bottle of wine. The Consul
539	reflected a few seconds and then asked for a whiskey.
540	'It occurs to me,' Sol Weintraub said as the group was finishing
541	dessert, 'that our survival may depend upon our talking to one another."
542	'What do you mean?" asked Brawne Lamia.
543	Weintraub unconsciously rocked the child sleeping against his chest.
544	'For instance, does anyone here know why he or she was chosen by the
545	Shrike Church and the
546	All Thing to go on this voyage?"
547	No one spoke.
548	'I thought not,' said Weintraub. 'Even more fascinating, is anyone here
549	a member or follower of the Church of the Shrike7 I, for one, am a Jew,
550	and however confused my religious notions have become these days, they
551	do not include the worship of an organic killing machine." Weintraub
552	raised eyebrows and looked around the table.
553	'I am the True Voice of the Tree,' said Het Masteen.
554	'While many Templars believe that the Shrike is the Avatar of punishment
555	for those who do not feed from the root, I must consider this a heresy
556	not founded in the Covenant or the writings of the Muir."
557	To the Captain's left, the Consul shrugged. 'I am an atheist,' he said,
558	holding the glass of whiskey to the light. 'I have never been in
559	contact with the Shrike cult."
560	Father Hoyt smiled without humor. 'The Catholic Church ordained me,' he
561	said. 'Shrike-worship contradicts everything the Church defends."
562	Colonel Kassad shook his head, whether in refusal to respond or to
563	indicate that he was not a member of the Shrike Church, it was not
564	clear.
565	Martin Silenus made an expansive gesture. 'I was baptized a Lutheran,'
566	he said. 'A subset which no longer exists. I helped create Zen
567	Gnosticism before any of your parents were born. i have been a
568	Catholic, a revelationist, a neo-Marxist, an interface zealot, a Bound
569	Shaker, a satanist, a bishop in the Church of Jake's Nada, and a
570	dues-paying subscriber to the Assured Reincarnation Institute. Now, I
571	am happy to say, I am a simple pagan." He smiled at everyone. 'To a
572	pagan,' he concluded, 'the Shrike is a most acceptable deity."
573	'I ignore religions,' said Brawne Lamia. 'I do not succumb to them."
574	'My point has been made, I believe,' said Sol Weintraub. 'None of us
575	admits to subscribing to the Shrike cult dogma, yet the elders of that
576	perceptive group have chosen us over many millions of the petitioning
577	faithful to visit the Time Tombs... and their fierce god... in what
578	may be the last such pilgrimage."
579	The Consul shook his head. 'Your point may be made, M. Weintraub,' he
580	said, 'but I fail to see it."
581	The scholar absently stroked his beard. 'It would seem that our reasons
582	for returning to Hyperion are so compelling that even the Shrike Church
583	and the Hegemony probability intelligences agree that we deserve to
584	return,' he said. 'Some of these reasons - mine, for instance - may
585	appear to be public knowledge, but I am certain that none are known in
586	their entirety except to the individuals at this table. I suggest that
587	we share our stories in the few days remaining to us."
588	'Why?" said Colonel Kassad. 'It would seem to serve no purpose."
589	Weintraub smiled. 'On the. contrary, it would - at the very least -
590	amuse us and give at least a glimpse of our fellow travelers' souls
591	before the Shrike or some other calamity distracts us. Beyond that, it
592	might just give us enough i .nsight to save all of our lives if we are
593	intelligent enough to find the common thread of experience which binds
594	all our fates to the whim of the Shrike."
595	Martin Silenus laughed and closed his eyes. He said:
596	'Straddling each a dolphin's back
597	And steadied by a fin,
598	Those Innocents re-live their death,
599	Their wounds open again. '
600	'That's Lenista, isn't it?" said Father Hoyt. 'I studied her in
601	seminary."
602	'Close,' said Silenus, opening his eyes and pouring more wine. 'It's
603	Yeats. Bugger lived five hundred years before Lenista tugged at her
604	mother's metal teat."
605	'Look,' said Lamia, 'what good would telling each other stories do? When
606	we meet the Shrike, we tell it what we want, one of us is granted the
607	wish, and the others die. Correct?"
608	'So goes the myth,' said Weintraub.
609	'The Shrike is no myth,' said Kassad. 'Nor its steel tree."
610	'So why bore each other with stories?" asked Brawne Lamia, spearing the
611	last of her chocolate cheesecake.
612	Weintraub gently touched the back of his sleeping infant's head. 'We
613	live in strange times,' he said.
614	'Because we are part of that one tenth of one tenth of one percent of
615	the Hegemony's citizens who travel between the stars rather than along
616	the Web, we represent odd epochs of our own recent past. I, for
617	example, am sixty-eight standard years old, but because of the
618	time-debts my travels could have incurred, I might have spread these
619	threescore and eight years across well more
620	than a century of Hegemony history."
621	'So?" said the woman next to him.
622	Weintraub opened his hand in a gesture which included everyone at the
623	table. 'Among us we represent islands of time as well as separate
624	oceans of perspective.
625	Or perhaps more aptly put, each of us may hold a piece to a puzzle no
626	one else has been able to solve since humankind first landed on
627	Hyperion." Weintraub scratched his nose. 'It is a mystery,' he said,
628	'and to tell the truth, I am intrigued by mysteries even if this is to
629	be my last week of enjoying them. I would welcome some glimmer of
630	understanding but, failing that, working on the puzzle will suffice."
631	'I agree,' said Her Masteen with no emotion. 'It had not occurred to
632	me, but I see the wisdom of telling our tales before we confront the
633	Shrike."
634	'But what's to keep us from lying?" asked Brawne Lamia.
635	'Nothing." Martin Silenus grinned. 'That's the beauty of it."
636	'We should put it to a vote,' said the Consul. He was thinking about
637	Meina Gladstone's contention that one of the group was an Ouster agent.
638	Would hearing the stories be a way of revealing the spy? The Consul
639	smiled at the thought of an agent so stupid.
640	'Who decided that we are a happylittle democracy?" Colonel Kassad asked
641	dryly.
642	'We had better be,' said the Consul. 'To reach our individual goals,
643	this group needs to reach the Shrike regions
644	together. We require some means of making decisions." 'We could appoint
645	a leader,' said Kassad.
646	'Piss on that,' the poet said in a pleasant tone. Others at the table
647	also shook their heads.
648	'All right,' said the Consul, 'we vote. Our first decision relates to
649	M. Weintraub's suggestion that we tell the stories of our past
650	involvement with Hyperion."
651	'All or nothing,' said Her Masteen. 'We each share our story or none
652	does. We will abide by the will of the majority."
653	'Agreed,' said the Consul, suddenly curious to hear the others tell
654	their stories and equally sure that he would
655	never tell his own. 'Those in favor of telling our tales?" 'Yes,' said
656	Sol Weintraub.
657	'Yes,' said Het Masteen.
658	'Absolutely,' said Martin Silenus. 'I wouldn't miss this little comic
659	farce for a month in the orgasm baths on Shote."
660	'I vote yes also,' said the Consul, surprising himself.
661	'Those opposed?"
662	'Nay,' said Father Hoyt but there was no energy in his voice.
663	'I think it's stupid,' said Brawne Lamia.
664	The Consul turned to Kassad. 'Colonel?" Fedmahn Kassad shrugged.
665	' I register four yes votes, two negatives, and one abstention,' said
666	the Consul. 'The ayes have it. Who wants to start?"
667	The table was silent. Finally Martin Silenus looked up from where he
668	had been writing on a small pad of paper.
669	He tore a sheet into several smaller strips. 'I've recorded numbers
670	from one to seven,' he said. 'Why don't we draw lots and go in the
671	order we draw?"
672	'That seems rather childish, doesn't it?" said M. Lamia.
673	'i'm a childish fellow,' responded Silenus with his
674	satyr's smile· 'Ambassador'-he nodded toward the Consul- 'could I borrow
675	that gilded pillow you're wearing for a hat?"
676	The Consul handed over his tricorne, the folded slips were dropped in,
677	and the hat passed around. Sol Weintraub was the first to draw, Martin
678	Silenus the last.
679	The Consul unfolded his slip, making sure that no one else could see it.
680	He was number seven. Tension ebbed out of him like air out of an
681	overinflated balloon. It was quite possible, he reasoned, that events
682	would intercede before he had to tell his story. Or the war would make
683	everything academic. Or the group could lose interest in stories. Or
684	the king could die. Or the horse could die. Or he could teach the
685	horse how to talk.
686	No more whiskey, thought the Consul.
687	'Who's first?" asked Martin Silenus.
688	In the brief silence, the Consul could hear leaves stirring to unfelt
689	breezes.
690	'I am,' said Father Hoyt. The priest's expression showed the same
691	barely submerged acceptance of pain which the Consul had seen on the
692	faces of terminally ill friends. Hoyt held up his slip of paper with a
693	large I clearly scrawled on it.
694	'All right,' said Silenus. 'Start."
695	'Now?" asked the priest.
696	'Why not?" said the poet. The only sign that Silenus had finished at
697	least two bottles of wine was a slight darkening of the already ruddy
698	cheeks and a somewhat more demonic tilt to the pitched eyebrows. 'We
699	have a few hours before planetfall,' he said, 'and I for one plan to
700	sleep off the freezer fugue when we're safely down and settled among the
701	simple natives."
702	'Our friend has a point,' Sol Weintraub said softly. 'If the tales are
703	to be told, the hour after dinner each day is a civilized time to tell
704	them."
705	Father Hoyt sighed and stood. 'Just a minute,' he said and left the
706	dining platform.
707	After some minutes had passed, Brawne Lamia said, 'Do you think he's
708	lost his nerve?"
709	'No,' said Lenar Hoyt, emerging from the darkness at the head of the
710	wooden escalator which served as the main staircase· 'I needed these."
711	He dropped two small, stained notebooks on the table as he took his
712	seat.
713	'No fair reading stories from a primer,' said Silenus.
714	'These are to be our own tall tales, Magus!'
715	'Shut up, damn it!" cried Hoyt. He ran a hand across his face, touched
716	his chest. For the second time that night, the Consul knew that he was
717	looking at a seriously ill man.
718	'I'm sorry,' said Father Hoyt. 'But if I'm to tell my ·.. my tale, I
719	have to tell someone else's story as well.
720	These journals belong to the man who was the reason for my coming to
721	Hyperion . . . and why I am returning today." Hoyt took a deep
722	breath.
723	The Consul touched the journals. They were begrimed and charred, as if
724	they had survived a fire. 'Your friend has old-fashioned tastes,' he
725	said, 'if he still keeps a written journal."
726	'Yes,' said Hoyt. 'If you're all ready, I will begin." The group at the
727	table nodded. Beneath the dining platform, a kilometer of treeship
728	drove through the cold night with the strong pulse of a living thing.
729	Sol Weintraub lifted his sleeping child from the infant carrier and
730	carefully set her on a cushioned mat on the floor near his chair. He
731	removed his comlog, set it near the mat, and programmed the diskey for
732	white noise. The week-old infant lay on her stomach and slept.
733	The Consul leaned far back and found the blue and green star which was
734	Hyperion. It seemed to grow larger even as he watched. Het Masteen
735	drew his cowl forward until only shadows showed for his face. Sol
736	Weintraub lighted a pipe. Others accepted refills of coffee and settled
737	back in their chairs.
738	Martin Silenus seemed the most avid and expectant of the listeners as he
739	leaned forward and whispered:
740	'He seyde, "Syn I shal bigynne the game,
741	What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!
742	Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what i seye."
743	And with that word we ryden forth oure weye;
744	And he bigan with right a myrie cheere
745	His tale anon, and seyde as ye may heere. '
746	THE PRIEST'S TALE: 'The Man Who Cried God'
747	'Sometimes there is a thin line separating orthodox zeal from apostasy,'
748	said Father Lenar Hoyt.
749	So began the priest's story. Later, dictating the tale into his
750	cornlog, the Consul remembered it as a seamless whole, minus the pauses,
751	hoarse voice, false starts, and small redundancies which were the
752	timeless failings of human speech.
753	Lenar Hoyt had been a young priest, born, raised, and only recently
754	ordained on the Catholic world of Pacem, when he was given his first
755	offworld assignment: he was ordered to escort the respected Jesuit
756	Father Paul Dur into quiet exile on the colony world of Hyperion.
757	In another time, Father Paul Dur certainly would have become a bishop
758	and perhaps a pope. Tall, thin, ascetic, with white hair receding from
759	a noble brow and eyes too filled with the sharp edge 'of experience to
760	hide their pain, Paul Dur was a follower of St Tellhard as well as an
761	archaeologist, ethnologist, and eminent Jesuit theologian. Despite the
762	decline of the Catholic Church into what amounted to a half-forgotten
763	cult tolerated because of its quaintness and isolation from the
764	mainstream of Hegemony life, Jesuit logic had not lost its bite. Nor
765	had Father Dur lost his conviction that the Holy Catholic Apostolic
766	Church continued to be humankind's last, best hope for immortality.
767	To Lenar Hoyt as a boy, Father Dur had been a somewhat godlike figure
768	when glimpsed during his rare visits to the preseminary schools, or on
769	the would-be seminarian's even rarer visits to the New Vatican. Then,
770	during the years of Hoyt's study in seminary, Dur had been on an
771	important Church-sponsored archaeological dig on the nearby world of
772	Armaghast. When the Jesuit returned, a few weeks after Hoyt's
773	ordination, it had been under a cloud. No one outside the highest
774	circles of the New Vatican knew precisely what had happened, but there
775	were whispers of excommunication and even of a hearing before the Holy
776	Office of the Inquisition, dormant the four centuries since the
777	confusion following the death of Earth.
778	Instead, Father Dur had asked for a posting to Hyperion, a world most
779	people knew of only because of the bizarre Shrike cult which had
780	originated there, and Father Hoyt had been chosen to accompany him. It
781	would be a thankless job, traveling in a role which combined the worst
782	aspects of apprentice, escort, and spy without even the satisfaction of
783	seeing a new world; Hoyt was under orders to see Father Dur down to the
784	Hyperion spaceport and then reboard the same spinship for its return
785	voyage to the Worldweb. What the bishopric was offering Lenar Hoyt was
786	twenty months in cryogenic fugue, a few weeks of in-system travel at
787	either end of the voyage, and a time-debt which would return him to
788	Pacem eight years behind his former classmates in the quest for Vatican
789	careers and missionary postings.
790	Bound by obedience and schooled in discipline, Lenar Hoyt accepted
791	without question.
792	Their transport, the aging spinship HS Nadia Oleg, was a pockmarked
793	metal tub with no artificial gravity of any sort when it was not under
794	drive, no viewports for the passengers, and no on-board recreation
795	except for the stimsims piped into the datalink to keep passengers in
796	their hammocks and fugue couches. After awakening from fugue, the
797	passengers - mostly offworld workers and economy-rate tourists with a
798	few cult mystics and would-be Shrike suicides thrown in for good measure
799	-slept in those same hammocks and fugue couches, ate recycled food in
800	featureless mess decks, and generally tried to cope with spacesickness
801	and boredom during their twelve-day, zero-g glide from their spinout
802	point to Hyperion.
803	Father Hoyt learned little from Father Dur during those days of forced
804	intimacy, nothing at all about the events on Armaghast which had sent
805	the senior priest into exile. The younger man had keyed his comlog
806	implant to seek out as much data as it could on Hyperion and, by the
807	time they were three days out from planet fall,
808	Father Hoyt considered himself somewhat of an expert on the world.
809	'There are records of Catholics coming to Hyperion but no mention of a
810	diocese there,' said Hoyt one evening as they hung talking in their
811	zero-g hammocks while most of their fellow passengers lay tuned into
812	erotic stimsims. 'I presume you're going down to do some mission work?"
813	'Not at all,' replied Father Dur. 'The good people of Hyperion have
814	done nothing to foist their religious opinions on me, so I see no reason
815	to offend them with my proselytizing. Actually, I hope to travel to the
816	southern continent- Aquila- and then find a way inland from the city of
817	Port Romance. But not in the guise of a missionary. I plan to set up
818	an ethnological research station along the Cleft."
819	'Research?" Father Hoyt had echoed in surprise. He closed his eyes to
820	key his implant. Looking again at Father Dur, he said, 'That section of
821	the Pinion Plateau isn't inhabited, Father. The flame forests make it
822	totally inaccessible most of the year."
823	Father Dur smiled and nodded. He carried no implant and his ancient
824	condog had been in his luggage for the duration of the trip. 'Not quite
825	inaccessible,' he said softly. 'And not quite uninhabited. The Bikura
826	live there."
827	'Bikura,' Father Hoyt said and closed his eyes. 'But they're just a
828	legend,' he said at last.
829	'Hmmm,' said Father Dur. 'Try cross-indexing through Mamet Spedling."
830	Father Hoyt closed his eyes again. General Index told him that Mamet
831	Spedling had been a minor explorer affiliated with the Shackleton
832	Institute on Renaissance Minor who, almost a standard century and a half
833	earlier, had filed a short report with the Institute in which he told of
834	hacking his way inland from the then newly settled Port Romance, through
835	swamplands which had since been reclaimed for fiberplastic plantations,
836	passing through the flame forests during a period of rare quietude, and
837	climbing high enough on the Pinion Plateau to encounter the Cleft and a
838	small tribe of humans who fit the profile of the legendary Bikura.
839	Spedling's brief notes hypothesized that the humans were survivors of a
840	missing seedship colony from three centuries earlier and clearly
841	described a group suffering all of the classic retrograde cultural
842	effects of extreme isolation, inhreeding, and overadaptation. In
843	Spedling's blunt words, '. · even after less than two days here it is
844	obvious that the Bikura are too stupid, lethargic, and dull to waste
845	time describing." As it turned out, the flame forests then began to show
846	some signs of becoming active and Spedling had not wasted any more time
847	observing his discovery but had rushed to reach the coast, losing four
848	indigenie bearers, all of his equipment and records, and his left arm to
849	the 'quiet' forest in the three months it took him to escape.
850	'My God,' Father Hoyt had said as he lay in his hammock on the Nadia
851	Oleg, 'why the Bikura?"
852	'Why not?" had been Father Dur's mild reply. 'Very little is known
853	about them."
854	'Very little is known about most of Hyperion,' said the younger priest,
855	becoming somewhat agitated. 'What about the Time Tombs and the
856	legendary Shrike north of the Bridle Range on Equus?" he said. 'They're
857	famous!'
858	'Precisely,' said Father Dur6. 'Lenar, how many learned papers have
859	been written on the Tombs and the Shrike creature? Hundreds?
860	Thousands?" The aging priest had tamped in tobacco and now lighted his
861	pipe: no small feat in zero-g, Hoyt observed. 'Besides,' said Paul
862	Dur6, 'even if the Shrike-thing is real, it is not human. I am partial
863	to human beings."
864	'Yes,' said Hoyt, ransacking his mental arsenal for potent arguments,
865	'but the Bikura are such a small mystery. At the most you're going to
866	find a few dozen indigenies living in a region so cloudy and smoky and
867	... unimportant that even the colony's own mapsats haven't noticed
868	them. Why choose them when there are big mysteries to study on
869	Hyperion.. · like the labyrinths!' Hoyt had brightened. 'Did you know
870	that Hyperion is one of the nine labyrinthine worlds, Father?"
871	'Of course,' said Dur. A rough hemisphere of smoke expanded from him
872	until air currents broke it into tendrils and tributaries. 'But the
873	labyrinths have their researchers and admirers throughout the Web,
874	Lenar, and the tunnels have been there - on all nine worlds -for how
875	long? Half a million standard years? Closer to three quarters of a
876	million, I believe. Their secret will last. But how long will the
877	Bikura culture last before they're absorbed into modern colonial society
878	or, more likely, are simply wiped out by circumstances?"
879	Hoyt shrugged. 'Perhaps they're already gone. It's been a long time
880	since Spedling's encounter with them and there haven't been any other
881	confirmed reports. If they are extinct as a group, then all of your
882	time-debt and labor and pain of getting there will be for nothing."
883	'Precisely,' was all that Father Paul Dur had said and puffed calmly on
884	his pipe.
885	It was in their last hour together, during the dropship ride down, that
886	Father Hoyt had gained the slightest glimpse into his companion's
887	thoughts. The limb of Hyperion had been glowing white and green and
888	lapis above them for hours when suddenly the old dropship had cut into
889	the upper layers of atmosphere, flame had briefly filled the window, and
890	then they were flying silently some sixty kilometers above dark cloud
891	masses and starlit seas with the hurtling terminator of Hyperion's
892	sunrise rushing toward them like a spectral tidal wave of light.
893	'Marvelous,' Paul Dur had whispered, more to himself than to his young
894	companion. 'Marvelous. It is at times like this that I have the
895	sense... the slightest sense · . . of what a sacrifice it must have
896	been for the Son of God to condescend to become the Son of Man."
897	Hoyt had wanted to talk then, but Father Dur had continued to stare out
898	the window, lost in thought. Ten minutes later they had landed at Keats
899	Interstellar, Father Dur was soon swept into the whirlpool of customs
900	and luggage rituals, and twenty minutes after that a thoroughly
901	disappointed Lenar Hoyt was rising toward space and the Nadia Oleg once
902	again.
903	'Five weeks later of my time, I returned to Pacem,' said Father Hoyt. 'I
904	had mislaid eight years but for some reason my sense of loss randeeper
905	than that simple fact.
906	Immediately upon my return, the bishop informed me that there had been
907	no word from Paul Dur during the four years of his stay on Hyperion. The
908	New Vatican had spent a fortune on fatline inquiries, but neither the
909	colonial authorities nor the consulate in Keats had been able to locate
910	the missing priest."
911	Hoyt paused to sip from his water glass and the Consul said, 'I remember
912	the search. I never met Dur6, of course, but we did our best to trace
913	him. Theo, my aide, spent a lot of energy over the years trying to
914	solve the case of the missing cleric. Other than a few contra-dietory
915	reports of sightings in Port Romance, there was no trace of him. And
916	those sightings went back to the weeks right after his arrival, years
917	before. There were hundreds of plantations out there with no radios or
918	cornlines, primarily because they were harvesting bootleg drugs as well
919	as fiberplastic. I guess we never talked to the people at the right
920	plantation. At least I know Father Dur's file was still open when I
921	left."
922	Father Hoyt nodded. 'I landed in Keats a month after your replacement
923	had taken over at the consulate. The bishop had been astonished when I
924	volunteered to return. His Holiness himself granted me an audience. I
925	was on Hyperion less than seven of its local months. By the time I left
926	to return to the Web, I had discovered the fate of Father Dur6." Hoyt
927	tapped the two stained leather books on the table. 'If I am to complete
928	this,' he said, his voice thick, 'I must read excerpts from these."
929	The treeship Yggdrasill had turned so the bulk of the tree had blocked
930	the sun. The effect was to plunge the dining platform and the curved
931	canopy of leaves beneath it into night, but instead of a few thousand
932	stars dotting the sky, as would have been the case from a planet's
933	surface, literally a million suns blazed above, beside, and beneath the
934	group at the table. Hyperion was a distinct sphere now, hurtling
935	directly at them like some deadly missile.
936	'Read,' said Martin Silenus.
937	FROM THE JOURNAL OF FATHER PAUL DURI :
938	Day l:
939	So begins my exile.
940	I am somewhat at a loss as to how to date my new journal. By the
941	monastic calendar on Pacere, it is the seventeenth day of Thomasmonth in
942	the Year of Our Lord 2732. By Hegemony Standard, it is October I2, 589
943	p.c. By Hyperion reckoning, or so I am told by the wizened little clerk
944	in the old hotel where I am staying, it is the twentyzthird day of
945	Lycius (the last of their seven forty-day months), either 426 A.D.C.
946	(after dropship crash!) or the hundred and twenty-eighth year of the
947	reign of Sad King Billy, who has not reigned for at least a hundred of
948	those years.
949	To hell with it. I'll call it Day I of my exile.
950	Exhausting day. (Strange to be tired after months of sleep, but that is
951	said to be a common reaction after awakening from fugue. My cells feel
952	the fatigue of Ihese past months of travel even if I do not remember
953	them. I don't remember feeling this tired from travel when I was
954	younger.)
955	I felt bad about not getting to know young Hoyt better. He seems a
956	decent sort, all proper catechism and bright eyes. It's no fault of
957	youngsters like him that the Church is in its final days. It's just
958	that his brand of happy naivet6 can do nothing to arrest that slide into
959	oblivion which the Church seems destined for.
960	Well, my contributions have not helped either.
961	Brilliant view of my new world as the dropship brought us down. I was
962	able to make out two of the three continents- Equus and Aquila. The
963	third one, Ursa, was not visible.
964	Planetfall at Keats and hours of effort getting through customs and
965	taking ground transit into the city. Confused images: the mountain
966	range to the north with its shifting, blue haze, foothills forested with
967	orange and yellow trees, pale sky with its green-blue undercoating, the
968	sun too small but more brilliant than Pacem's.
969	Colors seem more vivid from a distance, dissolving and scattering as one
970	approaches, like a pointillist's palette.
971	The great sculpture of Sad King Billy which I had heard so much about
972	was oddly disappointing. Seen from the highway, it looked raw and
973	rough, a hasty sketch chiseled from the dark mountain, rather than the
974	regal figure I had expected. It does brood over this ramshackle city of
975	half a million people in a way that the neurotic poet-king probably
976	would have appreciated.
977	The town itself seems to be separated into the sprawling maze of slums
978	and saloons which the locals call Jacktown and Keats itself, the
979	so-called Old City although it dates back only four centuries, all
980	polished stone and studied sterility. I will take the tour soon.
981	I had scheduled a month in Keats but already I am eager to press on. Oh,
982	Monsignor Edouard, if you could see me now. Punished but still
983	unrepentant. More alone than ever but strangely satisfied with my new
984	exile. If my punishment for past excesses brought about by my zeal is
985	to be banishment to the seventh circle of desolation, then Hyperion was
986	well chosen. I could forget my self-appointed mission to the distant
987	Bikura (are they real? I think not this night) and content myself with
988	living out the remainder of my years in this provincial capital on this
989	godforsaken backwater world. My exile would be no less complete.
990	Ah, Edouard, boys together, classmates together (although I was not so
991	brilliant nor so orthodox as you), now old men together. But now you
992	are four years wiser and I am still the mischievous, unrepentant boy you
993	remember. I pray that you are alive and well and praying for me.
994	Tired. Will sleep. Tomorrow, take the tour of Keats, eat well, and
995	arrange transport to Aquila and points south.
996	Day $:
997	There is a cathedral in Keats. Or, rather, there was one. It has been
998	abandoned for at least two standard centuries. It lies in ruins with
999	its transept open to the green-blue skies, one of its western towers
1000	unfinished, and the other tower a skeletal framework of tumbled stone
1001	and rusted reinforcement rods.
1002	I stumbled upon it while wandering, lost, along the banks of the Hoolie
1003	River in the 'sparsely populated section of town where the Old City
1004	decays into Jacktown amid a jumble of tall warehouses which prevent even
1005	a glimpse of the ruined towers of the cathedral until one turns a corner
1006	onto a narrow cul-de-sac and there is the shell of the cathedral; its
1007	chapter house has half fallen away into the river, its facade is pocked
1008	with remnants of the mournful, apocalyptic statuary of the post-Hegira
1009	expansionist period.
1010	I wandered through the latticework of shadows and fallen blocks into the
1011	nave. The bishopric on Paccm had not mentioned any history of
1012	Catholicism on Hyperion, much less the presence of a cathedral. It is
1013	almost inconceivable that the scattered seedship colony of four
1014	centuries ago could have supported a large enough congregation to
1015	warrant the presence of a bishop, much less a cathedral. Yet there it
1016	was.
1017	I poked through the shadows of the sacristy. Dust and powdered plaster
1018	hung in the air like incense, outlining two shafts of sunlight streaming
1019	down from narrow windows high above. I stepped out into a broader patch
1020	of sunlight and approached an altar stripped of all decoration except
1021	for chips and cracks caused by falling masonry. The great cross which
1022	had hung on the east wall behind the altar had also fallen and now lay
1023	in ceramic splinters among the heap of stones there. Without conscious
1024	thought I stepped behind the altar, raised my arms, and began the
1025	celebration of the Eucharist.
1026	There was no sense of parody or melodrama in this act, no symbolism or
1027	hidden intention; it was merely the automatic reaction of a priest who
1028	had said Mass almost daily for more than forty-six years of his life and
1029	who
1030	now faced the prospect of never again participating in the reassuring
1031	ritual of that celebration.
1032	It was with some shock that I realized I had a congregation.
1033	The old woman was kneeling in the fourth row of pews. The black of her
1034	dress and scarf blended so perfectly with the shadows there that only
1035	the pale oval of her face was visible, lined and ancient, floating
1036	disembodied in the darkness. Startled, I stopped speaking the litany of
1037	consecration. She was looking at me but something about her eyes, even
1038	at a distance, instantly convinced me that she was blind. For a moment
1039	I could not speak and stood there mute, squinting in the dusty light
1040	bathing the altar, trying to explain this spectral image to myself while
1041	at the same time attempting to frame an explanation of my own presence
1042	and actions.
1043	When I did find my voice and called to her- the words echoing in the
1044	great hall - I realized that she had moved. I could hear her feet
1045	scraping on the stone floor.
1046	There was a rasping sound and then a brief flare of light illuminated
1047	her profile far to the right of the altar. I shielded my eyes from the
1048	shafts of sunlight and began picking my way over the detritus where the
1049	altar railing had once stood. I called to her again, offered
1050	reassurances, and told her not to be afraid, even though it was I who
1051	had chills coursing up my back. I moved quickly but when I reached the
1052	sheltered corner of the nave she was gone. A small door led to the
1053	crumbling chapter house and the riverbank. There was no sign of her. I
1054	returned to the dark interior and would have gladly attributed her
1055	appearance to my imagination, a waking dream after so many months of
1056	enforced cryogenic dreamlesshess, but for a single, tangible proof of
1057	her presence. There in the cool darkness burned a lone red votive
1058	candle, its tiny flame flickering to unseen drafts and currents.
1059	I am tired of this city. I am tired of its pagan pretensions and false
1060	histories. Hyperion is a poet's world devoid of poetry. Keats itself
1061	is a mixture of tawdry, false classicism and mindless, boomtown energy.
1062	There are three Zen Gnostic assemblies and four High Muslim mosques in
1063	the town, but the real houses
1064	of worship are the countless saloons and brothels, the huge marketplaces
1065	handling the fiberplastic shipments from the south, and the Shrike Cult
1066	temples where lost souls hide their suicidal hopelessness behind a
1067	shield of shallow mysticism. The whole planet reeks of mysticism
1068	without revelation.
1069	To hell with it.
1070	Tomorrow I head south. There are skimmers and other aircraft on this
1071	absurd world but, for the Common Folk, travel between these accursed
1072	island continents seems restricted to boat- which takes forever, I am
1073	told- or one of the huge passenger dirigibles which de!arts from Keats
1074	only once a week.
1075	I leave early tomorrow by dirigible.
1076	Day I0:
1077	Animals.
1078	The firstdown team for this planet must have had a f',ation on animals.
1079	Horse, Bear, Eagle. For three days we were creeping down the east coast
1080	of Equus over an irregular coastline called the Mane. We've spent the
1081	last day making the crossing of a short span of the Middle Sea to a
1082	large island called Cat Key. Today we are offloading passengers and
1083	freight at Felix, the 'major city' of the island. From what I can see
1084	from the observation promenade and the mooring tower, there can't be
1085	more than five thousand people living in that random collection of
1086	hovels and barracks.
1087	Next the ship will make its eight-hundred-kilometer crawl down a series
1088	of smaller islands called the Nine Tails and then take a bold leap
1089	across seven hundred kilometers of open sea and the equator. The next
1090	land we see then is the northwest coast of Aquila, the
1091	so-called Beak.
1092	Animals.
1093	To call this conveyance a 'passenger dirigible' is an exercise in
1094	creative semantics. It is a huge lifting device with cargo holds large
1095	enough to carry the town of Felix out to sea and still have room for
1096	thousands of bales of
1097	fiberplastic. Meanwhile, the less important cargo - we passengers -
1098	make do wherewe can. I have set up a cot near the aft loading portal
1099	.and made a rather comfortable niche for myself with my personal luggage
1100	and three large trunks of expedition gear. Near me is a family of
1101	eight- indigenie plantation workers returning from a biannual shopping
1102	expedition of their own to Keats -and although I do not mind the sound
1103	or scent of their caged pigs or the squeal of their food hamsters, the
1104	incessant, confused crowing of their poor befuddled rooster is more than
1105	I can stand some nights.
1106	Animals!
1107	Day II:
1108	Dinner tonight in the salon above the promenade deck with Citizen
1109	Heremis Denzel, a retired professor from a small planters' college near
1110	Endymion. He informed me that the Hyperion firstdown team had no animal
1111	fetish after all; the official names of the three continents are not
1112	Equus, Ursa, and Aquila, but Creighton, Allensen, and Lopez. He went on
1113	to say that this was in honor of three middle-level bureaucrats in the
1114	old Survey Service.
1115	Better the animal fetish!
1116	It is after dinner. I am alone on the outside promenade to watch the
1117	sunset. The walkway here is sheltered by the forward cargo modules so
1118	the wind is little more than a salt-tinged breeze. Above me curves the
1119	orange and green skin of the dirigible. We are between islands; the sea
1120	is a rich lapis shot through with verdant undertones, a reversal of sky
1121	tones. A scattering of high cirrus catches the last light of Hyperion's
1122	too-small sun and ignites like burning coral. There is no sound except
1123	for the faintest hum of the electric turbines. Three hundred meters
1124	below, the shadow of a huge, mantalike undersea creature keeps pace with
1125	the dirigible. A second ago an insect or bird the size and color of a
1126	hummingbird but with gossamer wings a meter across paused five meters
1127	out to inspect me before diving toward the sea with folded wings.
1128	Edouard, I feel very alone tonight. !t would help if I knew you were
1129	alive, still wbrking in the garden, writing evenings in your study. I
1130	thought my travels would stir my-old beliefs in St Teilhard's concept of
1131	the God in Whom the Christ of Evolution, the Personal, and the
1132	Universal, the En Haut and the En.4 vant are joined, but no such renewal
1133	is forthcoming.
1134	It is growing dark. I am growing old. I feel something ·.. not yet
1135	remorse . .. at my sin of falsifying the evidence on the Armaghast
1136	dig. But, Edouard, Your Excellency, if the artifacts had indicated the
1137	presence of a Christ-oriented culture there, six hundred light-years
1138	from Old Earth, almost three thousand years before man left the surface
1139	of the homeworld...
1140	Was it so dark a sin to interpret such ambiguous data in a way which
1141	would have meant the resurgence of Christianity in our life-time?
1142	Yes, it was. But not, I think, because of the sin of tampering with the
1143	data, but the deeper sin of thinking that Christianity could be saved.
1144	The Church is dying, Edouard. And not merely our beloved branch of the
1145	Holy Tree, but all of its offshoots, vestiges and cankers.
1146	The entire Body of Christ is dying as surely as this poorly used body of
1147	mine, Edouard. You and I knew this in Armaghast, where the blood-sun
1148	illuminated only dust and death. We knew it that cool, green summer at
1149	the College when we took our first vows. We knew it as boys in the
1150	quiet playfields of Villefranche-sur-SaSne. We know it now.
1151	The light is gone now; I must write by the slight glow from the salon
1152	windows a deck above. The stars lie in strange constellations. The
1153	Middle Sea glows at night with a greenish, unhealthy phosphorescence.
1154	There is a dark mass on the horizon to the southeast. It may be a storm
1155	or it may be the next island in the chain, the third of the nine
1156	'tails." (What mythology deals with a cat with nine tails? I know of
1157	none.)
1158	For the sake of the bird I saw earlier - if it was a bird - I pray that
1159	it is an island ahead and not a storm.
1160	Day 28:
1161	I have been in Port Romance eight days and I have seen three dead men.
1162	The first was a beached corpse, a bloated, white parody of a man, that
1163	had washed up on the mud flats beyond the mooring tower my first evening
1164	in town.
1165	Children threw stones at it.
1166	The second man I watched being pulled from the burned wreckage of a
1167	methane-unit shop in the poor section of town near my hotel. His body
1168	was charred beyond recognition and shrunken by the heat, his arms and
1169	legs pulled tight in the prizefighter posture burning victims have been
1170	reduced to since time immemorial. I had been fasting all day and I
1171	confess with shame that I began to salivate when the air filled with the
1172	rich, frying-fat odor of burned flesh.
1173	The third man was murdered not three meters from me. I had just emerged
1174	from the hotel onto the maze of mud-splattered planks that serve as
1175	sidewalks in this miserable town when shots rang out and a man several
1176	paces ahead of me lurched as if his foot had slipped, spun toward me
1177	with a qui=ical look on his face, and fell sideways into the mud and
1178	sewage.
1179	He had been shot three times with some sort of projectile weapon. Two
1180	of the bullets had struck his chest, the third entered just below the
1181	left eye.
1182	Incredibly, he was still breathing when I reached him.
1183	Without thinking about it, I removed my stole from my carrying bag,
1184	fumbled for the vial of holy water I had carried for so long, and
1185	proceeded to perform the sac-rameut of Extreme Unction. No one in the
1186	gathering crowd objected. The fallen man stirred once, cleared his
1187	throat as if he were about to speak, and died. The crowd dispersed even
1188	before the body was removed.
1189	The man was middle-aged, sandy-haired, and slightly overweight. He
1190	carried no identification, not even a universal card or comlog. There
1191	were six silver coins in his pocket.
1192	For some reason, I elected to stay with the body the rest of that day.
1193	The doctor was a short and cynical man
1194	who allowed me to stay during the required autopsy. !
1195	suspect that he was starved for conversation.
1196	'This is what the whole thing's worth,' he said as he opened the poor
1197	man'd belly like a pink satchel, pulling the folds of skin and muscle
1198	back and pinning them down like tent flaps.
1199	'What thing?" I asked.
1200	'His life,' said the doctor and pulled the skin of the corpse's face up
1201	and back like a greasy mask. 'Your life.
1202	My life." The red and white stripes of overlapping muscle turned to blue
1203	bruise around the ragged hole just above the cheekbone.
1204	'There has to be more than this,' I said.
1205	The doctor looked up from his grim work with a bemused smile. 'Is
1206	there?" he said. 'Please show me." He lifted the man's heart and seemed
1207	to weigh it in one hand. 'In the Web worlds, this'd be worth some money
1208	on the open market. There're those too poor to keep vat-grown, cloned
1209	parts in store, but too well off to die just for want of a heart. But
1210	out here it's just offal."
1211	'There has to be more,' I said, although I felt little conviction. I
1212	remembered the funeral of His Holiness Pope Urban XV shortly before I
1213	left Pacem. As has been the custom since pre-Heglra days, the corpse
1214	was not embalmed. It waited in the anteroom off the main basilica to be
1215	fitted for the plain wooden coffin. As I helped Edouard and Monsignor
1216	Frey place the vestments on the stiffened corpse I noticed the browning
1217	skin and slackening mouth.
1218	The doctor shrugged and finished the perfunctory autopsy. There was the
1219	briefest of formal inquiries. No suspect was found, no motive put
1220	forward. A description of the murdered man was sent to Keats but the
1221	man himself was buried the next day in a pauper's field between the mud
1222	flats and the yellow jungle.
1223	Port Romance is a jumble of yellow, weirwood structures set on a maze of
1224	scaffolds and planks stretching far out onto the tidal mud flats at the
1225	mouth of the Kans.
1226	The river is almost two kilometers wide here where it spills out into
1227	Toschahai Bay, but only a few channels are navigable and the dredging
1228	goes on day and night. !
1229	lie awake each night in my cheap room with the window open to the
1230	pounding of the dredge-hammer sounding like the booming of this vile
1231	city's heart, the distant susurration of the surf its wet breathing.
1232	Tonight I listen to the city breathe and cannot help but give it the
1233	flayed face of the murdered man.
1234	The companies keep a skimmerport on the edge of town to ferry men and
1235	matriel inland to the larger plantations, but I do not have enough money
1236	to bribe my way aboard. Rather, I could get myself aboard but cannot
1237	afford to transport my three trunks of medical and scientific gear. I
1238	am still tempted. My service among the Bikura seems more absurd and
1239	irrational now than ever before. Only my strange need for a destination
1240	and a certain masochistic determination to complete the terms of my
1241	self-imposed exile keep me moving upriver.
1242	There is a riverboat departing up the Kans in two days. I have booked
1243	passage and will move my trunks onto it tomorrow. It will not be hard
1244	to leave Port Romance behind.
1245	Day 4I:
1246	The Emporotic Girandole continues its slow progress upriver. No sight
1247	of human habitation since we left Melton's Landing two days ago. The
1248	jungle presses down to the riverbank like a solid wall now; more, it
1249	almost completely overhangs us in places where the river narrows to
1250	thirty or forty meterS. The light itself is yellow, rich as liquid
1251	butter, filtered as it is through foliage and fronds eighty meters above
1252	the brown surface of the Kans. I sit on the rusted tin roof of the
1253	center passenger barge and strain to make out my first glimpse of a
1254	tesla tree. Old Kady sitting nearby pauses in his whittling, spits over
1255	the side through a gap in his teeth, and laughs at me. 'Ain't going to
1256	be no flame trees this far down,' he says. 'If they was the forest sure
1257	all hell wouldn't look like this. You got to get up in the Pinions
1258	before you see a tesla. We ain't out of the rain forest yet, Padre."
1259	It rains every afternoon. Actually, rain is too gentle a term for the
1260	deluge that strikes us each day, obscuring the shore, pounding the tin
1261	roofs of the barges with a deafening roar, and slowing our upstream
1262	crawl until it seems we are standing still. It is ns if the river
1263	becomes a vertical torrent each afternoon, a waterfall which the ship
1264	must climb if we are to go on.
1265	The Oirandole is an ancient, flat-bottomed tow with five barges lashed
1266	around it like ragged children clinging to their tired motheris skins.
1267	Three of the two-level barges carry bales of goods to be traded or sold
1268	at the few plantations and settlements along the river. The other two
1269	offer a simulacrum of lodging for the indigenies traveling upriver,
1270	although I suspect that some of the barge's residents are permanent. My
1271	own berth boasts a stained mattress on the floor and lizard-like insects
1272	on the walls.
1273	After the rains everyone gathers on the decks to watch the evening mists
1274	rise from the cooling river. The air 'is very hot and supersaturated
1275	with moisture most of the day now. Old Kady tells me that I have come
1276	too late to make the climb through the rain and flame forests before the
1277	tesla trees become active. We shall see.
1278	Tonight the mists rise like the spirits of all the dead who sleep
1279	beneath the river's dark surface. The last tattered remnants of the
1280	afternoon's cloud cover dissipate through the treetops and color returns
1281	to the world. I watch ns the dense forest shifts from chrome yellow to
1282	a translucent saffron and then slowly fades through ocher to umber to
1283	gloom. Aboard the Girandole, Old Kady lights the lanterns and
1284	candle-globes hanging from the sagging second tier and, as if not to be
1285	outdone, the darkened jungle begins to glow with the faint
1286	phosphorescence of decay while glowbirds and multihued gossamers can be
1287	seen floating from branch to branch in the darker upper regions.
1288	Hyperion's small moon is not visible tonight but this world moves
1289	through more debris than is common for a planet so close to its sun and
1290	the night skies are illuminated by frequent meteor showers. Tonight the
1291	heavens are especially fertile and when we move onto wide sections of
1292	the river we can see a tracery of brilliant meteor trails weaving the
1293	stars together. Their images burn the retina after a while and I look
1294	down at the river only to see the same optic echo there in the dark
1295	waters.
1296	There is a bright glow on the eastern horizon and Old Kady tells me that
1297	this is from the orbital mirrors which give light to a few of the larger
1298	plantations.
1299	It is too warm to return to my cabin. I spread my thin mat on the
1300	rooftop of my barge and watch the celestial light show while clusters of
1301	indigenie families sing haunting songs in an argot I have. not even
1302	tried to learn. I wonder about the Bikura, still far away from here,
1303	and a strange anxiety rises in me.
1304	Somewhere in the forest an animal screams with the voice of a frightened
1305	woman.
1306	Day60:
1307	Arrived Perecebo Plantation. Sick.
1308	Day 62:
1309	Very ill. Fever, fits of shaking. All yesterday ! was vomiting black
1310	bile. The rain is deafening. At night the clouds are !it from above by
1311	orbital mirrors. The sky seems to be on fire. My fever is very high.
1312	A woman takes care of me. Bathes me. Too sick to be ashamed. Her hair
1313	is darker than most indigenies'. She says little. Dark, gentle eyes.
1314	Oh, God, to be sick so far from home.
1315	Day
1316	sheis waiting spying comesin from the rain the thin shirt
1317	on purpose to tempt me, knows what iam my skin burning on fire thin
1318	cotton nipples dark against it i
1319	knowwho they are they are watching, here hear their voices at night they
1320	bathe me in poison burns me they think I dont know but i hear their
1321	voices above the rain when the screaming stops stop stop
1322	My skin is almost gone. red underneath can feel the hole in my cheek.
1323	when I find the bullet iwill spit it out it out.
1324	agnusdeiquitolispecattamundi miserer nobis misere nobis miserere
1325	Day 65:
1326	Thank you, dear Lord, for deliverance from illness.
1327	Day 66:
1328	Shaved today. Was able to make it to the shower.
1329	Semfa helped me prepare for the administrator's visit. I expected him
1330	to be one of the large, gruff types I've seen out the window working in
1331	the sorting compound, but he was a quiet black man with a slight lisp.
1332	He was most helpful. I had been concerned about paying for my medical
1333	care but he reassured me that there would be no charge. Even better -
1334	he will assign a man to lead me into the high country! He says it is
1335	late in the season but if I can travel in ten days we should be able to
1336	make it through the flame forest to the Cleft before the tesla trees are
1337	fully active.
1338	After he left I sat and talked to Semfa a bit. Her husband died here
1339	three local months ago in a harvesting accident. Semfa herself had come
1340	from Port Romance; her marriage to Mikel had been a salvation for her
1341	and she has chosen to stay on here doing odd jobs rather than go back
1342	downriver. I do not blame her.
1343	After a massage, I will sleep. Many dreams about my mother recently.
1344	Ten days. I will be ready in ten days.
1345	Day 75:
1346	Before leaving with Tuk, I went down to the matrix paddies to say
1347	goodbye to Semfa. She said little but I could see in her eyes that she
1348	was sad to see me go.
1349	Without premeditation, I blessed her and then kissed her on the
1350	forehead. Tuk stood nearby, smiling and bobbing. Then we were off,
1351	leading the two packbrids.
1352	Supervisor Orlandi came to the end of the road and waved as we entered
1353	the narrow lane hacked into the
1354	aureate foliage.
1355	Domine, dirige nos.
1356	Day 82:
1357	After a week on the trail - what trail? - after a week in the
1358	trackless, yellow rain forest, after a week of exhausting climb up the
1359	ever steeper shoulder of the.
1360	Pinion Plateau, we emerged this morning onto a rocky outcropping that
1361	allowed us a view back across an expanse of jungle toward the Beak and
1362	the Middle Sea.
1363	The plateau here is almost three thousand meters above sea level and the
1364	view was impressive. Heavy rain clouds spread out below us to the foot
1365	of the Pinion Hills, but through gaps in the white and gray carpet of
1366	cloud we caught glimpses of the Kans in its leisurely uncoiling toward
1367	Port R. and the sea, chrome-yellow swatches of the forest we had
1368	struggled through, and a hint of magenta far to the east that Tuk swore
1369	was the lower matrix of fiberplastic fields near Perecebo.
1370	We continued onward and upward late into the evening.
1371	Tuk is obviously worried that we will be caught in the flame forests
1372	when the tesla trees become active. I struggle to .keep up, tugging at
1373	the heavily laden 'brid and saying silent prayers to keep my mind off my
1374	aches, pains, and general misgivings.
1375	Day 83:
1376	Loaded and moving before dawn today. The air smells of smoke and ashes.
1377	The change in vegetation here on the Plateau is startling.
1378	No longer evident are the ubiquitous weirwood and leafy chalma. After
1379	passing through an intermediate zone of short evergreens and everblues,
1380	then after climbing again through dense strands of mutated lodgepole
1381	pines and triaspen, we came into the flame forest proper with its groves
1382	of tall prometheus, trailers of ever present phoenix, and round stands
1383	of amber !ambents. Occasionally we encountered impenetrable breaks of
1384	the white-fibrous, bifurcated bestos plants that Tuk picturesquely
1385	referred to as '... looking like de rotting cocks o' some dead giants
1386	what be buried shallow here, dat be sure." My guide has a way with
1387	words.
1388	It was late afternoon before we saw our first tesla tree. For half an
1389	hour we had been trudging over an ash-covered forest floor, trying not
1390	to tread on the tender shoots of phoenix and firewhip gamely pushing up
1391	through the sooty soil, when suddenly Tuk stopped and pointed.
1392	The tesla tree, still half a kilometer away, stood at least a hundred
1393	meters tall, half again as high as the tallest prometheus. Near its
1394	crown it bulged with the distinctive onion-shaped dome of its
1395	accumulator gall.
1396	The radial branches above the gall trailed dozens of nimbus vines, each
1397	looking silver and metallic against the clear green and lapis sky. The
1398	whole thing made me think of some elegant High Muslim mosque on New
1399	Mecca irreverently garlanded with tinsel.
1400	'We got to get de 'brids and our asses de hell out o' here,' grunted
1401	Tuk. He insisted that we change into flame forest gear right then and
1402	there. We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening trudging on in
1403	our osmosis masks and thick, rubber-soled boots, sweating under layers
1404	of leathery gamma-cloth. Both of the 'brids acted nervous, their long
1405	ears pricking at the slightest sound. Even through my mask i could
1406	smell the ozone; it reminded me of electric trains I had played with as
1407	a child oj lazy Christmas Day afternoons in Vi!!efranche-sur-Sa6ne.
1408	We are camping as close as we can to a bestos break this night. Tuk
1409	showed me how to set out the ring of arrestor rods, all the time
1410	clucking dire warnings to himself and searching the evening sky for
1411	clouds.
1412	I plan to sleep well in spite of everything.
1413	Day 84:
1414	0400 hours- Sweet Mother of Christ.
1415	For three hours we have been caught up in the middle of the end of the
1416	world.
1417	The explosions started shortly after midnight, mere lightning crashes at
1418	first, and against our better judgment Tuk and I slid our heads through
1419	the tent flap to watch the pyrotechnics. I am used to the Matthew-month
1420	monsoon storms on Pacem, so the first hour of lightning displays did not
1421	seem too unusual. Only the sight of distant tesla trees as the unerring
1422	focus of the aerial discharge was a bit unnerving. But soon the forest
1423	behemoths were glowing and spitting with their own accumulated energy
1424	and then - just as I was drifting off to sleep despite the continued
1425	noise - true Armageddon was unleashed.
1426	At least a hundred arcs of electricity must have been released in the
1427	first ten seconds of the tesla trees' opening spasms of violent energy.
1428	A prometheus less than thirty meters from us exploded, dropping flaming
1429	brands fifty meters to the forest floor. The arrestor rods glowed,
1430	hissed, and deflected arc after arc of blue-white death over and around
1431	our small campsite. Tuk screamed something but no mere human sound was
1432	audible over the onslaught of light and noise. A patch of trailing
1433	phoenix burst into flame near the tethered 'brids and one of the
1434	terrified animals - hobbled and blindfolded as it was - broke free and
1435	lunged through the circle of glowing arrestor rods. Instantly half a
1436	dozen bolts of lightning from the nearest tesla arced to the hapless
1437	animal. For a mad second l could have sworn !
1438	saw the beast's skeleton glowing through boiling flesh and then it
1439	spasreed high into the air and simply ceased to be.
1440	For three hours we have watched the end of the world.
1441	Two of the arrestor rods have fallen but the other eight continue to
1442	function. Tuk and I huddle in the hot cave of our tent, osmosis masks
1443	filtering enough cool oxygen out of the superheated, smoky air to allow
1444	us to breathe. Only the lack of undergrowth and Tuk's skill in placing
1445	our tent away from other targets and near the sheltering bestos plants
1446	have allowed us to survive. That and the eight whiskered-alloy rods
1447	that stand between us and eternity.
1448	'They seem to be holding up well!" I shout to Tuk over the hiss and
1449	crackle, crash and split of the storm.
1450	'Dey be made to stand de hour, mebbe two,' grunts my guide. 'Any time,
1451	mebbe sooner, dey fuse, we die."
1452	I nod and sip at lukewarm water through the slipstrip of my osmosis
1453	mask. If I survive this night, I shall always thank God for His
1454	generosity in allowing me to see this sight.
1455	Day 8 7:
1456	Tuk and I emerged from the smoldering northeastern edge of the flame
1457	forest at noon yesterday, promptly set up camp by the edge of a small
1458	stream, and slept for eighteen hours straight; making up for three
1459	nights of no sleep and two grueling days moving without rest through a
1460	nightmare of flame and ash. Everywhere we looked as we approached the
1461	hogback ridge that marked the terminus of the forest, we could see
1462	seedpods and cones burst open with new life for the various fire species
1463	that had died in the conflagration of the previous two nights. Five of
1464	our arrestor rods still functioned, although neither Tuk nor l was eager
1465	to test them another night. Our surviving packbrid collapsed and died
1466	the instant the heavy load was lifted off its back.
1467	I awoke this morning at dawn to the sound of running water. I followed
1468	the small stream a kilometer to the northeast, following a deepening in
1469	its sound, until suddenly it dropped from sight.
1470	The Cleft! I had almost forgotten our destination.
1471	This morning, stumbling through the fog, leaping from one wet rock to
1472	another alongside the widening stream, I took a leap to a final boulder,
1473	teetered there, regained my balance, and looked straight down above a
1474	waterfall that dropped almost three thousand meters to mist, rock, and
1475	river far below.
1476	The Cleft was not carved out of the rising plateau as was the legendary
1477	Grand Canyon on Old Earth or World Crack on Hebron. In spite of its
1478	active oceans and seemingly earthlike continents, Hyperion is
1479	tectonically quite dead; more like Mars, Lusus, or Armaghast in its
1480	total lack of continental drift. And like Mars and Lusus, HYperion is
1481	afflicted with its Deep Ice Ages, although here the periodicity is
1482	spread to thirty-seven million years by the long ellipse of the
1483	currently absent binary dwarf. The comlog compares the Cleft to the
1484	pre-tCrraformed Mariner Valley on Mars, both being caused by the
1485	weakening of crust through periodic freeze and thaw over the aeons,
1486	followed by the flow of subterranean rivers such as the Kans. Then the
1487	massive collapse, running like a long scar through the moun-tainons wing
1488	of the continent Aquila.
1489	Tuk joined me as I stood on the edge of the Cleft. I was naked, rinsing
1490	the ash smell from my traveling clothes and cassock. I splashed cold
1491	water over my pale flesh and laughed out loud as the echoes of Tuk's
1492	shouts came back from the North Wall two thirds of a kilometer away.
1493	Because of the nature of the crust collapse, Tuk and I stood far out on
1494	an overhang that hid the South Wall below us. Although perilously
1495	exposed, we assumed that the rocky cornice which had defied gravity for
1496	millions of years would last a few more hours as we bathed, relaxed,
1497	shouted echoing hallos until we were hoarse, and generally acted like
1498	children liberated from school. Tuk confessed that he had never
1499	penetrated the full width of the flame forest- nor known anyone who had
1500	in this season - and announced that, now that the tesla trees were
1501	becoming fully
1502	dozen bolts of lightning from the nearest tesla arced to the hapless
1503	animal. For a mad second I could have sworn !
1504	saw the beast's skeleton glowing through boiling flesh and then it
1505	spasmed high into the air and simply ceased to be.
1506	For three hours we have watched the end of the world.
1507	Two of the arrestor rods have fallen but the other eight continue to
1508	function. Tuk and I huddle in the hot cave of our tent, osmosis masks
1509	filtering enough c°°! oxygen out of the superheated, smoky air to allow
1510	us to breathe. Only the lack of undergrowth and Tuk's skill in placing
1511	our tent away from other targets and near the sheltering bestos plants
1512	have allowed us to survive. That and the eight whiskered-alloy rods
1513	that stand between us and eternity.
1514	'They seem to be holding up well!" I shout to Tuk over the hiss and
1515	crackle, crash and split of the storm.
1516	'Dey be made to stand de hour, mebbe two,' grunts my guide. 'Any time,
1517	mebbe sooner, dey fuse, we die."
1518	I nod and sip at lukewarm water through the slipstrip of my osmosis
1519	mask. If I survive this night, I shall always thank God for His
1520	generosity in allowing me to see this sight.
1521	Day87:
1522	Tuk and I emerged from the smoldering northeastern edge of the flame
1523	forest at noon yesterday, promptly set up camp by the edge of a small
1524	stream, and slept for eighteen hours straight; making up for three
1525	nights of no sleep and two grueling days moving without rest through a
1526	nightmare of flame and ash. Everywhere we looked as we approached the
1527	hogback ridge that marked the terminus of the forest, we could see

1530	our arrestor rods still functioned, although neither Tuk nor I was eager

1536	The Cleft! I had almost forgotten our destination.
1537	This morning, stumbling through the fog, leaping from one wet rock to
1538	another alongside the widening stream, I took a leap to a final boulder,
1539	teetered there, regained my balance, and looked straight down above a
1540	waterfall that dropped almost three thousand meters to mist, rock, and
1541	river far below.
1542	The Cleft was not carved out of the rising plateau as was the legendary

1551	weakening of crust through periodic freeze and thaw over the aeons,
1552	followed by the flow of subterranean rivers such as the Kans. Then the
1553	massive collapse, running like a long scar through the mountainous wing
1554	of the continent Aquila.
1555	Tuk joined me as I stood on the edge of the Cleft. I was naked, rinsing
1556	the ash smell from my traveling clothes and cassock. I splashed cold
1557	water over my pale flesh and laughed out loud as the echoes of Tuk's
1558	shouts came back from the North Wall two thirds of a kilometer away.
1559	Because of the nature of the crust collapse, Tuk and I stood far out on
1560	an overhang that hid the South Wall below us. Although perilously
1561	exposed, we assumed that the rocky cornice which had defied gravity for
1562	millions of years would last a few more hours as we bathed, relaxed,
1563	shouted echoing hallos until we were hoarse, and generally acted like
1564	children liberated from school. Tuk confessed that he had never
1565	penetrated the full width of the flame forest- nor known anyone who had
1566	in this season - and announced that, now that the tesla trees were
1567	becoming fully
1568	active, he would have at least a three-month wait until he could return.
1569	He did not seem too sorry and I was glad to have him with me.
1570	In the afternoon we transported my gear in relays, setting up camp near
1571	the stream a hundred meters back from the cornice and stacking my
1572	flowfoam boxes of scientific gear for further sorting in the morning.
1573	It was cold this evening. After dinner, just before sunset, I pulled on
1574	my thermal jacket and walked alone to a rocky ledge southwest of where I
1575	had first encountered the Cleft. From my vantage point far out over the
1576	river, the view was memorable. Mists rose from unseen waterfalls
1577	tumbling to the river far below, spray rising in shifting curtains of
1578	mist to multiply the setting sun into a dozen violet spheres and twice
1579	that many rainbows.
1580	I watched as each spectrum was born, rose toward the darkening dome of
1581	sky, and died. As the cooling air settled into the cracks and caverns
1582	of the plateau and the warm air rushed skyward, pulling leaves, twigs,
1583	and mist upward in a vertical gale, a sound ebbed up out of the Cleft as
1584	if the continent itself was calling with the voices of stone giants,
1585	gigantic bamboo flutes, church organs the size of palaces, the clear,
1586	perfect notes ranging from the shrillest soprano to the deepest bass. I
1587	speculated on wind vectors against the fluted rock wails, on caverns far
1588	below venting deep cracks in the motionless crust, and on the illusion
1589	of human voices that random harmonics can generate. But in the end l
1590	set aside speculation and simply listened as the Cleft sang its farewell
1591	hymn to the sun.
1592	I walked back to our tent and its circle of biolumi-nescent lantern
1593	light as the first fusillade of meteor showers burned the skies overhead
1594	and distant explosions from the flame forests rippled along the southern
1595	and western horizons like cannon fire from some ancient war on
1596	pre-Hegira Old Earth.
1597	Once in the tent I try the long-range comlog bands but there is nothing
1598	but static. I suspect that even if the primitive comsats that serve the
1599	fiberplastic plantations were ever to broadcast this far east, anything
1600	but the tightest laser or fatline beams would be masked by the mountains
1601	and tesla activity. On Pacem, few of us at the monastery wore or
1602	carried personal comlogs, but the datasphere was always there if we
1603	needed to tap into it. Here there is no choice.
1604	I sit and listen to the last notes from the canyon wind die, watch the
1605	skies simultaneously darken and blaze, smile at the sound of Tuk's
1606	snoring from his bedroll outside the tent, and I think to myself, If
1607	this is exile, so belt.
1608	Day 88:
1609	Tuk is dead. Murdered.
1610	I found his body when I left the tent at sunrise. He had been sleeping
1611	outside, not more than four meters from me. He had said that he wished
1612	to sleep under the stars.
1613	The murderers cut his throat while he slept. I heard no cry. I did
1614	dream, however: dreams of Semfa ministering to me during my fever.
1615	Dreams of cool hands touching my neck and chest, touching the crucifix I
1616	have worn since childhood. I stood over Tuk's body, staring at the
1617	wide, dark circle where his blood had soaked into Hyperion's uncaring
1618	soil, and I shivered at the thought that the dream had been more than a
1619	dream - that hands had touched me in the night.
1620	I confess that I reacted more like a frightened old fool than as a
1621	priest. I did administer Extreme Unction, but then the panic struck me
1622	and I left my poor guide's body, desperately searched through the
1623	supplies for a weapon, and took away the machete I had used in the rain
1624	forest and the low-voltage maser with which I had planned to hunt small
1625	game. Whether I would have used a weapon on a human being, even to save
1626	my own life, I do not know. But, in my panic, I carried the machete,
1627	the maser, and the powered binoculars to a high boulder near the Cleft
1628	and searched the region for any signs of the murderers. Nothing stirred
1629	except the tiny arboreais and gossamers we had seen flitting through the
1630	trees yesterday. The forest itself seemed
1631	abnormally thick and dark. The Cleft offered a hundred terraces,
1632	ledges, and rock balconies to the northeast for entire bands of savages.
1633	An army could have hidden there in the crags and ever present mists.
1634	After-thirty minutes of fruitless vigilance and foolish cowardice, I
1635	returned to the campsite and prepared Tuk's body for burial. It took me
1636	well over two hours to dig a proper grave in the rocky soil of the
1637	plateau.
1638	When it was filled and the formal service was finished, I could think of
1639	nothing personal to say about the rough, funny little man who had been
1640	my guide. 'Watch over him, Lord,' I said at last, disgusted at my own
1641	hypocrisy, sure in my heart that I was mouthing words only to myself.
1642	'Give him safe passage. Amen."
1643	This evening I have moved my camp half a kilometer north. My tent is
1644	pitched in an open area ten meters away but I am wedged with my back
1645	against the boulder, sleeping robes pulled around, the machete and maser
1646	nearby. After Tuk's funeral I went through the supplies and boxes of
1647	equipment. Nothing had been taken except for the few remaining'
1648	arrestor rods.
1649	Immediately I wondered if someone had followed us through the flame
1650	forest in order to kill Tuk and strand me here, but I could think of no
1651	motive for such an elaborate action. Anyone from the plantations could
1652	have killed us as we slept in the rain forest or - better yet from a
1653	murderer's point of view - deep in the flame forest where no one would
1654	wonder at two charred corpses. That left the Bikura. My primitive
1655	charges.
1656	I considered returning through the flame forest without the rods but
1657	soon abandoned the idea. It is probable death to stay and certain death
1658	to go.
1659	Three months before the teslas become dormant. One hundred twenty of
1660	the twenty-six-hour local days. An eternity.
1661	Dear Christ, why has this come to me.9 And why was I spared last night
1662	if I am merely to be offered up this night... or next?
1663	I sit here under the darkening crag and I listen to the suddenly ominous
1664	moaning rising with the night wind
1665	from the Cleft and I pray as the sky lights with the blood-red streaks
1666	of meteor trails.
1667	Mouthing words to myself.
1668	Day 9.5:
1669	The terrors of the past week have largely abated. I find that even fear
1670	fades and becomes commonplace after days of anticlimax.
1671	I used the machete to cut small trees for a lean-to, covering the roof
1672	and side with gamma-cloth and caulking between the logs with mud. The
1673	back wall is the solid stone of the boulder. I have sorted through my
1674	research gear and set some of it out, although I suspect that I will
1675	never use it now.
1676	I have begun foraging to supplement my quickly diminishing cache of
1677	freeze-dried food. By now, according to the absurd schedule drawn up so
1678	long ago on Pacem, I was to have been living with the Bikura for some
1679	weeks and trading small goods for local food. No matter. Besides my
1680	diet of bland but easily boiled chalma roots, I have found half a dozen
1681	varieties of berries and larger fruits that the comlog assures me are
1682	edible; so far only one has disagreed with me enough to keep me
1683	squatting all night near the edge of the nearest ravine.
1684	I pace the confines of the region as restlessly as one of those caged
1685	pelops that were so prized by the minor padishahs on Armaghast. A
1686	kilometer to the south and four to the west, the flame forests are in
1687	full form. In the morning, smoke vies with the shifting curtains of
1688	mist to hide the sky. Only the near-solid breaks of bestos, the rocky
1689	soil here on the summit plateau, and the hogback ridges running like
1690	armor-plated vertebrae northeast from here keep the teslas at bay.
1691	To the north, the plateau widens out and the undergrowth becomes denser
1692	near the Cleft for some fifteen kilometers until the way is blocked by a
1693	ravine a third as deep and half as wide as the Cleft itself. Yesterday
1694	I reached this northernmost point and stared across the
1695	gaping barrier with some frustration. I will try again someday,
1696	detouring to the east to find a crossing point, but from the telltale
1697	signs of phoenix across the chasm and the pall of smoke along the
1698	northeastern horizon, I suspect I will find only the chalma-fi!led
1699	canyons and steppes of flame forest that are roughed in on the orbital
1700	survey map I carry.
1701	Tonight I visited Tuk's rocky grave as the evening wind began to wail
1702	its aeolian dirge. I knelt there and tried to pray but nothing came.
1703	Edouard, nothing came. I am as empty as those fake sarcophagi that you
1704	and I unearthed by the score from the sterile desert sands near Tarum
1705	bel Wadi.
1706	The Zen Gnostics would say that this emptiness is a good sign; that it
1707	presages openness to a new level of
1708	awareness, new insights, new experience.
1709	Merde.
1710	My emptiness is only... emptiness.
1711	I have found the Bikura. Or, rather, they have found me. I will write
1712	what I can before they come to rouse me from my 'sleep."
1713	Today I was doing some detail mapping a mere four kilometers north of
1714	camp when the mists lifted in the midday warmth and I noticed a series
1715	of terraces on my side of the Cleft that had been hidden until then. I
1716	was using my powered glasses to inspect the terraces - actually a series
1717	of !addered ledges, spires, shelves, and tussocks extending far out onto
1718	the overhang - when i realized that I was staring at man-made
1719	habitations.
1720	The dozen or so huts were crude- rough hovels of heaped chalma fronds,
1721	stones, and spongeturf- but they were unmistakably of human origin.
1722	I was standing there irresolute, binoculars still lifted, trying to
1723	decide whether to climb down to the exposed ledges and confront the
1724	inhabitants or to retreat to my camp, when I felt that lifting chill
1725	along the back and neck that tells one with absolute certainty that he
1726	is no
1727	longer alone. I. lowered the binoculars and turned slowly. The Bikura
1728	were there, at least thirty of them, standing in a semi-circle that left
1729	me no retreat to the forest.
1730	I do not know what I expected; naked savages, perhaps, with fierce
1731	expressions and necklaces of teeth.
1732	Perhaps I had half expected to find the kind of bearded, wild-haired
1733	hermits that travelers sometimes encountered in the Mosh6 Mountains on
1734	Hebron. Whatever I had held in mind, the reality of the Bikura did not
1735	fit the template.
1736	The people who had approached me so silently were short - none came
1737	higher than my shoulder - and swathed in roughly woven dark robes that
1738	covered them from neck to toe. When they moved, as some did now, they
1739	seemed to glide over the rough ground like wraiths.
1740	From a distance, their appearance reminded me of nothing so much as a
1741	gaggle of diminutive Jesuits at a New Vatican enclave.
1742	I almost giggled then, but realized that such a response might well be a
1743	sign of rising panic. The Bikura showed no outward signs of aggression
1744	to cause such a panic; they carried no weapons, their small hands were
1745	empty. As empty as their expressions.
1746	Their physiognomy is hard to describe succinctly.
1747	They are bald. All of them. That baldness, the absence of any facial
1748	hair, and the loose robes that fell in a straight line to the ground,
1749	all conspired to make it very difficult to tell the men from the women.
1750	The group now confronting me- more than fifty by this time - looked to
1751	be all of roughly the same age: somewhere between forty and fifty
1752	standard years. Their faces were smooth, the skin tinged with a
1753	yellowish cast that I guessed might be associated with generations of
1754	ingesting trace minerals in the chalma and other local plant life.
1755	One might be tempted to describe the round faces of the Bikura as
1756	cherubic until, upon closer inspection, that impression of sweetness
1757	fades and is replaced by another interpretation- placid idiocy. As a
1758	priest, I have spent enough time on backward worlds to see the
1759	effects of an ancient genetic disorder variously called Down's syndrome,
1760	mongolism, or generation-ship legacy. This, then, was the overall
1761	impression created by the sixty or so dark-robed little people who had
1762	approached me - I was being greeted by a silent, smiling band of bald,
1763	retarded children.
1764	I reminded myself that these were almost certainly the same group of
1765	'smiling children' who had slit Tuk's throat while he slept and left him
1766	to die like a butchered pig.
1767	The closest Bikura stepped forward, stopped five paces from me, and said
1768	something in a soft monotone.
1769	'Just a minute,' I said and fumbled out my cornlog. I tapped in the
1770	translator function.
1771	'Beyetet ota menna !or cresfem ket?" asked the short man in front of me.
1772	I slipped on the hearplug just in time to hear the comlng's translation.
1773	There was no lag time. The apparently foreign.language was a simple
1774	corruption of archaic seedship English not so far removed from the
1775	indigene argot of the plantations. 'You are the man who belongs to the
1776	cross shape/cruciform,' interpreted the cornlog, giving me two choices
1777	for the final noun.
1778	'Yes,' I said, knowing now that these were the ones who had touched me
1779	the night I slept through Tuk's murder. Which meant that these were the
1780	ones who had murdered Tuk.
1781	! waited. The hunting maser was in my pack. The pack was set against
1782	a small chalma not ten paces from me. Half a dozen Bikura stood between
1783	me and it. It did not matter. I knew at that instant that I would not
1784	use a weapon against another human being, even a human being who had
1785	murdered my guide and might well be planning to murder me at any second.
1786	I closed my eyes and said a silent Act of Contrition. When I opened my
1787	eyes, more of the Bikura had arrived.. There was a cessation of
1788	movement, as if a quorum had been filled, a decision reached.
1789	'Yes,' I said again into the silence, 'I am the one who wears the
1790	cross." I heard the cornlog speaker pronounce the last word 'cresfem."
1791	The Bikura nodded in unison and - as if from long practice as altar
1792	boys- all went to one knee, robes rustling softly, in a perfect
1793	genuflection.
1794	I opened my mouth to speak and found that I had nothing to say. I
1795	closed my mouth.
1796	The Bikura stood. A breeze moved the brittle chalma fronds and leaves
1797	together to make a dry, end-of-summer sound above us. The Bikura
1798	nearest to me on the left stepped closer, grasped my forearm with a
1799	touch of cool, strong fingers, and spoke a soft sentence that my comlog
1800	translated as, 'Come. It is time to go to the houses and sleep."
1801	It was midafternoon. Wondering if the comlog had translated the word
1802	'sleep' properly or if it might be an idiom or metaphor for 'die,' I
1803	nodded and followed them toward the village at the edge of the Cleft.
1804	Now I sit in the hut and wait. There are rustling sounds. Someone else
1805	is awake now. I sit and wait.
1806	Day 97:
1807	The Bikura call themselves the 'Three Score and Ten."
1808	I have spent the past twenty-six hours talking to them, observing,
1809	making notes when they take their two-hour, midafternoon 'sleep,' and
1810	generally trying to record as much data as I can before they decide to
1811	slit my throat.
1812	Except now I am beginning to believe that they will not hurt me.
1813	I spoke to them yesterday after our 'sleep." Sometimes they do not
1814	respond to questions and when they do the responses are little better
1815	than the grunts or divergent answers one receives from slow children.
1816	After their initial question and invitation at our first encounter, none
1817	of them originated a single query or comment my way.
1818	! questioned them subtly, carefully, cautiously, and with the
1819	professional calm of a trained ethnologist. I asked the simplest, most
1820	factual questions possible to
1821	make sure that the'comlog was functioning properly. It was. But the
1822	sum total of the answers left me almost as ignorant as I had been
1823	twenty-some hours before.
1824	Finally, tired in body and spirit, I abandoned professional subtlety and
1825	asked the group I was sitting with, 'Did you kill my companion?"
1826	My three interlocutors did not look up from the weaving they were doing
1827	on a crude loom. 'Yes,' said the one I have come to think of as Alpha
1828	because he had been the first to approach me in the forest, 'we cut your
1829	companion's throat with sharpened stones and held him down and silent
1830	while he struggled. He died the true death."
1831	'Why?" I asked after a moment. My voice sounded as dry as a corn husk
1832	crumbling.
1833	'Why did he die the true death?" said Alpha, still not looking up.
1834	'Because all of his blood ran out and he stopped breathing."
1835	'No,' I said. 'Why did you kill him?"
1836	Alpha did not respond, but Betty - who may or may not be female and
1837	Alpha's mate - looked up from her
1838	loom and said simply, 'To make him die."
1839	'Why?"
1840	The responses invariably came back and just as invariably failed to
1841	enlightened me one iota. After much questioning, I had ascertained that
1842	they had killed Tuk to make him die and that he had died because he had
1843	been killed.
1844	'What is the difference between death and true death?" I asked, not
1845	trusting the cornlog or my temper at this point.
1846	The third Bikura, Del, grunted a response that the comlog interpreted
1847	as, 'Your companion died the true death. You did not."
1848	Finally, in frustration far too close to rage, I snapped, 'Why not? Why
1849	didn't you kill me?"
1850	All three stopped in the middle of their mindless weaving and looked at
1851	me. 'You cannot be killed because you cannot die,' said Alpha. 'You
1852	cannot die because you belong to the cruciform and follow the way of the
1853	cross."
1854	I had no idea why the damn machine would translate cross as 'cross' one
1855	second and as 'cruciform' the next.
1856	Because you belong to the cruciform.
1857	A chill went through me, followed by the urge to laugh. Had I stumbled
1858	into that old adventure hoI0 clich - the lost tribe that worshiped the
1859	'god' that had tumbled into their jungle until the poor bastard cuts
1860	himself shaving or something, and the tribespeople, assured and a bit
1861	relieved at the obvious mortality of their visitor, offer up their
1862	erstwhile deity as a sacrifice?
1863	It would have been funny if the image of Tuk's bloodless face and
1864	raw-rimmed, gaping wound was not so fresh.
1865	Their reaction to the cross certainly suggested that l had encountered a
1866	group of survivors of a once Christian colony - Catholics? - even
1867	though the data in the comiog insisted that the dropship of seventy
1868	colonists who had crashed on this plateau four hundred years ago had
1869	held only Neo-Kerwin Marxists, all of whom should have been indifferent
1870	if not openly hostile to the old religions.
1871	I considered dropping the matter as being far too dangerous to pursue,
1872	but my stupid need to know drove me on. 'Do you worship Jesus?" I
1873	asked.
1874	Their blank expressions left no need for a verbal negative.
1875	'Christ?" I tired again. 'Jesus Christ? Christian? The
1876	Catholic Church?"
1877	No interest.
1878	'Catholic? Jesus? Mary? St Peter? Paul? St Tellhard?"
1879	The comiog made noises but the words seemed to have no meaning for them.
1880	'You follow the cross?" I said, flailing for some last contact.
1881	All three looked at me. 'We belong to the cruciform,' said Alpha.
1882	I nodded, understanding nothing.
1883	This evening I fell asleep briefly just before sunset and when I awoke
1884	it was to the organ-pipe music of the Cleft's nightfall winds. It was
1885	much louder here on the
1886	village ledges. Even the hovels seemed to join the chorus as the rising
1887	gusts whistled and whined through stone gaps, flapping fronds, and crude
1888	smokeholes.
1889	Something was wrong. It took me a groggy minute to realize that the
1890	village was abandoned. Every hut was empty. I sat on a cold boulder
1891	and wondered if my presence had sparked some mass exodus. The wind
1892	music had ended and meteors were beginning their nightly show through
1893	cracks in low clouds when I heard a sound behind me and turned to find
1894	all seventy of the Three Score and Ten behind me.
1895	They walked past without a word and went to their huts. There were no
1896	lights. I imagined them sitting in their hovels, staring.
1897	I stayed outside for some time before returning to my own hut. After a
1898	while I walked to the edge of the grassy shelf and stood where rock
1899	dropped away into the abyss. A cluster of vines and roots clung to the
1900	cliff face but appeared to end a few meters into space and hang there
1901	above emptiness. No vine could have been long enough to offer a way to
1902	the river two kilometers below.
1903	But the Bikura had come from this direction.
1904	Nothing made sense. I shook my head and went back to my hut.
1905	Sitting here, writing by the light of the cornlog diskey, I try to think
1906	of precautions I can take to insure that I will see the sunrise.
1907	I can think of none.
1908	Day I03:
1909	The more I learn, the less I understand.
1910	I have moved most of my gear to the hut they leave empty for me here in
1911	the village.
1912	I have taken photographs, recorded video and audio chips, and imaged a
1913	full holoscan of the village and its inhabitants. They do not seem to
1914	care. I project their images and they walk right through them, showing
1915	no interest. I play back their words to them and they smile
1916	and go back into their hovels to sit for hours, doing nothing, saying
1917	nothing. I offer them trade trinkets and they take them without
1918	comment, check to see if they are edible, and then leave them lying. The
1919	grass is littered with plastic beads, mirrors, bits of colored cloth,
1920	and cheap pens.
1921	I have set up the full medical lab but to no avail; the Three Score and
1922	Ten will not let me examine them, will not let me take blood samples,
1923	even though I have repeatedly shown them that it is painless, will not
1924	let me scan them with the diagnostic equipment - will not, in short,
1925	cooperate in any way. They do not argue. They do not explain. They
1926	simply turn away and go about their nonbusiness.
1927	After a Week I still cannot tell the males from the females. Their
1928	faces remind me of those visual puzzles that shift forms as you stare;
1929	sometimes Betty's face looks undeniably female and ten seconds later the
1930	sense of gender is gone and I think of her (him?) as Beta again. Their
1931	voices undergo the same shift. Soft, well modulated, sexless ... they
1932	remind me of the poorly programmed homecomps one encounters on backward
1933	worlds.
1934	I find myself hoping to catch a glimpse of a naked Bikura. This is not
1935	easy for a Jesuit of forty-eight standard years to admit. Still, it
1936	would not be an easy task even for a veteran voyeur. The nudity taboo
1937	seems absolute. They wear the long robes while awake and during their
1938	two-hour midday nap. They leave the village area to urinate and
1939	defecate, and I suspect that they do not remove the loose robes even
1940	then. They do not seem to bathe. One would suspect that this would
1941	cause olfactory problems, but there is no odor about these primitives
1942	except for the slight, sweet smell of chalma. 'You must undress
1943	sometimes,' I said to Alpha one day, abandoning delicacy in favor of
1944	information.
1945	'No,' said AI and went elsewhere to sit and do nothing while fully
1946	dressed.
1947	They have no names. I found this incredible at first, but now I am
1948	sure.
1949	'We are all that was and will be,' said the shortest
1950	Bikura, one I think of as female and call Eppie. 'We are the Three
1951	Score and Ten."
1952	i searched the cornlog records and confirmed what I suspected: in more
1953	than sixteen thousand known human societies, none are listed where there
1954	are no individual names at all. Even in the Lusus hive societies,
1955	individuals respond to their class category followed by a simple code.
1956	I tell them my name and they stare. 'Father Paul Dur, Father Paul Dur,'
1957	repeats the cornlog translator but there is no attempt at even simple
1958	repetition.
1959	Except for their mass disappearances each day before sunset and their
1960	common two-hour sleep time, they do very little as a group. Even their
1961	lodging arrangements appear random. AI will spend one naptime with
1962	Betty, the next with Gam, and the third with Zelda or Pete. No system
1963	or schedule is apparent. Every third day the entire group of seventy
1964	goes into the forest to forage and returns with berries, chalma roots
1965	and bark, fruit, and whatever else might be edible. I was sure they
1966	were vegetarians until I saw Del munching on the cold corpse of an
1967	infant arboreal. The little primate must have fallen from the high
1968	branches. It seems then that the Three Score and Ten do not disdain
1969	meat; they simply are too stupid to hunt and kill it.
1970	When the Bikura are thirsty they walk almost three hundred meters to a
1971	stream that cascades into the Cleft.
1972	In spite of this inconvenience, there are no signs of water skins, jugs,
1973	or any type of pottery. I keep my reserve of water in ten-gallon
1974	plastic containers but the villagers take no notice. In my plummeting
1975	respect for these people, I do not find it unlikely that they have spent
1976	generations in a village with no handy water source.
1977	'Who built the houses?" I ask. They have no word for viiiaBe.
1978	'The Three Score and Ten,' responds Will. I can tell him from the
1979	others only by a broken finger that did not mend well. Each of them has
1980	at !cast one such distinguishing feature, although sometimes I think it
1981	would be easier to tell crows apart.
1982	'When did they build them?" I ask, although I should know by now that
1983	any question that starts with 'when'
1984	will not receive an answer.
1985	I receive no answer.
1986	They do go into the Cleft each evening. Down the vines. On the third
1987	evening, I tried to observe this exodus but six of them turned me back
1988	from the edge and gently but persistently brought me back to my hut.
1989	It was the first observable action of the Bikura that had hinted at
1990	aggression and I sat in some apprehension after they had gone.
1991	The next evening as they departed I went quietly to my hut, not even
1992	peering out, but after they returned I retrieved the imager and its
1993	tripod from where I had left them near the edge. The timer had worked
1994	perfectly.
1995	The hOlos showed the Bikura grabbing the vines and scrambling down the
1996	cliff face as nimbly as the little arboreals that fill the chalma and
1997	weirwood forest.
1998	Then they disappeared under the overhang.
1999	'What do you do when you go down the cliff each evening?" I asked AI the
2000	next day.
2001	The native looked at me with the seraphic, Buddha smile I have learned
2002	to hate. 'You belong to the cruciform,' he said as if that answered
2003	everything.
2004	'Do you worship when you go down the cliff?." I asked.
2005	No answer.
2006	I thought a minute. 'I also follow the cross,' I said, knowing that it
2007	would be translated as 'belong to the cruciform." Any day now I will not
2008	need the translator program. But this conversation was too important to
2009	leave to chance. 'Does this mean that I should join you when you go
2010	down the cliff face?"
2011	For a second I thought that AI was thinking. His brow furrowed and I
2012	realized that it was the first time that I had seen one of the Three
2013	Score and Ten come close to frowning. Then he said, 'You cannot. You
2014	belong to the cruciform but you are not of the Three Score and Ten."
2015	I realized that it had taken every neuron and synapse in his brain to
2016	frame that distinction.
2017	'What would you do if ! did go down the cliff face?" I asked, expecting
2018	no response. Hypothetical questions almost always had as much luck as
2019	my time-based queries.
2020	This time he did respond. The seraphic smile and untroubled countenance
2021	returned and Alpha said softly, 'If you try to go down the cliff we will
2022	hold you down on the grass, take sharpened stones, cut your throat, and
2023	wait until your blood stops flowing and your heart stops beating."
2024	I said nothing. I wondered if he could hear the pounding of my heart at
2025	that moment. Well, I thought, at least you don't have to worry any
2026	longer that they think you are a .god.
2027	The silence stretched. Finally AI added one more sentence that I have
2028	been thinking about ever since. 'And if you did it again,' he said, 'we
2029	would have to kill you again."
2030	We stared at each other for some time after that; each convinced, I am
2031	sure, that the other was a total idiot.
2032	Day I04:
2033	Each new revelation adds to my confusion.
2034	The absence of children here has bothered me since my first day in the
2035	village. Looking back through my notes, I find frequent mention of it
2036	in the daily observations I have dictated to my comlog, but no record of
2037	it in the personal mishmash here that I call a journal. Perhaps the
2038	implications were too frightening.
2039	To my frequent and clumsy attempts at piercing this mystery, the Three
2040	Score and Ten have offered their usual enlightenment. The person
2041	questioned smiles beatifically and responds in some non sequitur that
2042	would make the babble of the Web's worst village idiot seem like sage
2043	aphorisms in comparison. More often than not, they do not answer at
2044	all.
2045	One day I stood in front of the one I have tagged as Dei, stayed there
2046	until he had to acknowledge my presence, and asked, 'Why are there no
2047	children?"
2048	'We are the Three Score and Ten,' he said softly.
2049	'Where are the babies?"
2050	No response. No sense of evading the question, merely a blank stare.
2051	i took a breath. 'Who is the youngest among you?" Del appeared to be
2052	thinking, wrestling with the concept.
2053	He was overmatched. I wondered if the Bikura had lost their time sense
2054	so completely that any such question was doomed. After a minute of
2055	silence, however, Del pointed to where AI was crouched in the sunlight,
2056	working with his crude hand loom, and said, 'There is the last one to
2057	return."
2058	'To return?" I said. 'From where?"
2059	Del stared at me with no emotion, not even impatience.
2060	'You belong to the cruciform,' he said. 'You must know the way of the
2061	cross."
2062	I nodded. I knew enough to recognize that in this direction lay one of
2063	the many conversational illogic-loops that usually derailed our
2064	dialogues. I hunted for some way to keep a grasp of the thin thread of
2065	information.
2066	'Then AI,' I said and pointed, 'is the last to be born. To return. But
2067	others will... return?"
2068	I was not sure that I understood my own question.
2069	How does one inquire about birth when the interviewee has no word for
2070	child and no concept of time? But Del seemed to understand. He nodded.
2071	Encouraged, I asked, 'Then when will the next of the Three Score and Ten
2072	be born? Return?"
2073	'No one can return until one dies,' he said.
2074	Suddenly I thought I understood. 'So no new children...
2075	no one will be returned until someone dies,' I said. 'You replace the
2076	missing one with another to keep the group at Three Score and Ten?"
2077	Del responded with the type of silence I had come to interpret as
2078	assent.
2079	The pattern seemed clear enough. The Bikura were quite serious about
2080	their Three Score and Ten. They kept the tribal population at seventy -
2081	the same number recorded on the passenger list of the dropship that
2082	crashed here four hundred years ago. Little chance of coincidence
2083	there. When someone died, they allowed a
2084	child .to be born to replace the adult. Simple.
2085	Simple but impossible. Nature and biology do not work that neatly.
2086	Besides the problem of minimum-herd population, there were other
2087	absurdities. Even though it is difficult to tell the ages of these
2088	smooth-skinned people, it is obvious that no more than ten years
2089	separates the oldest from the youngest. Although they act like
2090	children, I would guess their average age to be in the late thirties or
2091	mid-forties in standard years.
2092	So where are the very old? Where are the parents, aging uncles, and
2093	unmarried aunts? At this rate, the entire tribe will enter old age at
2094	approximately the same time.
2095	What happens when they all pass beyond childbearing age and it comes
2096	time to replace members of the tribe?
2097	The Bikura lead dull, sedentary lives. The accident rate-even while
2098	living on the very edge of the Cleft - must be low. There are no
2099	predators. the seasonal variations are minimal and the food supply
2100	almost certainly remains stable. But, granted all this, there must have
2101	been times in the four-hundred-year history of this baffling group when
2102	disease swept the village, when more than the usual number of vines gave
2103	way and dropped citizens into the Cleft, or when something caused that
2104	abnormal cluster of sudden deaths that insurance companies have dreaded
2105	since time immemorial.
2106	And then what? Do they breed to make up the difference and then revert
2107	to their current sexless behavior?
2108	Are the Bikura so different from every other recorded human society that
2109	they have a rutting period once every few years - once a decade? - once
2110	in a lifetime?
2111	It is doubtful.
2112	I sit here in my hut and review the possibilities. One is that these
2113	people live very long lifetimes and can reproduce during most of that
2114	time, allowing for simple replacement of tribal casualties. Only this
2115	does not explain their common ages. And there is no mechanism to
2116	explain any such longevity. The best anti-aging drugs the Hegemony has
2117	to offer only manage to extend an active lifetime a bit over the hundred
2118	standard-year mark. Preventive health measures have spread the vitality
2119	of early middle age well into the late sixties - my age - but except for
2120	clonal transplants, bioengi-neering, and other perqs for the very rich,
2121	no one in the Worldweb can expect to begin planning a family when they
2122	are seventy or expect to dance at their hundred-and-tenth birthday
2123	party. if eating chalma roots or breathing the pure air of the Pinion
2124	Plateau had a dramatic effect on retarding aging, it would be a sure bet
2125	that everyone on Hyperion would be living here munching chalma, that
2126	this planet would have had a farcaster centuries ago, and that every
2127	citizen of the Hegemony who has a universal card would be planning to
2128	spend vacations and retirement here.
2129	No, a more logical conclusion is that the Bikura live normal-length
2130	lives, have children at a normal rate, but kill them unless a
2131	replacement is required. They may practice abstinence or birth control-
2132	other than slaughtering the newborn- until the entire band reaches an
2133	age where new blood will soon be needed. A mass-birthing time explains
2134	the apparent common age of the members of the tribe.
2135	But who teaches the young? What happens to the parents and other older
2136	people? Do the Bikura pass along the rudiments of their crude excuse
2137	for a culture and then allow their own deaths? Would this be a 'true
2138	death' - the rubbing out of an entire generation? Do the Three Score
2139	and Ten murder individuals at both ends of the be!l-shaped age curve?
2140	This type of speculation is useless. I am beginning to get furious at
2141	my own lack of problem-solving skills.
2142	Let's form a strategy here and act on it, Paul. Get off your lazy,
2143	Jesuit ass.
2144	PROBLEM: How to tell the sexes apart?
2145	SOLUTION." Cajole or coerce a few of these poor devils into a medical
2146	exam. Find out what all the sex-role mystery and nudity taboo is about.
2147	A society that depends upon years of rigid sexual abstinence for
2148	population control is consistent with my new theory.
2149	PROBLEM: Why are they so fanatical about maintaining the same Three
2150	Score and Ten population that the lost dropship colony started with?
2151	SOLUTION: Keep pestering them until you find out.
2152	PROBLEM: Where are the children?
2153	SOLUTION: Keep pressing and poking until you find out. Perhaps the
2154	evening excursion down the cliff is related to all of this. There may
2155	be a nursery there. Or a pile of small bones.
2156	PROBLEM: What/s this 'belong to the cruciform' and 'way of the cross'
2157	business if not a contorted vestige of the original colonists' religious
2158	belief?.
2159	SOLUTION: Find out by going to the source. Could
2160	their daily descent down the cliff be religious in nature?
2161	PROBLEM: 'What/S down the cliff face?
2162	SOLUTION: GO down and see.
2163	Tomorrow, if their pattern holds true, all threescore and ten of the
2164	Three Score and Ten will wander into the woods for several hours of
2165	foraging. This time I will go with them.
2166	This time I am going over the edge and down the cliff.
2167	Day I05:
2168	0930 hours o Thank you, O Lord, for allowing me to see what I have seen
2169	today.
2170	Thank you, O Lord, for bringing me to this place at
2171	this time to see the proof of Your Presence.
2172	II25 hours - Edouard... Edouard!
2173	I have to return. To show you all! To show ,everyone.
2174	l've packed everything I need, putting the imager disks and film in a
2175	pouch I wove from bestos leaves. I have food, water, the maser with its
2176	weakening charge.
2177	Tent. Sleep robes.
2178	If only the arrestor rods had not been stolen!
2179	The Bikura might have kept them. No, i've searched the hovels and the
2180	nearby forest. They would have no use for them.
2181	It doesn't matter!
2182	I'll leave today if I can. Otherwise, as soon as I can.
2183	Edouard! I have it all here on the film and disks.
2184	"00- There is no way through the flame forests today. The smoke drove
2185	me back even before I penetrated the edge of the active zone.
2186	I returned to the village and went over the holos.
2187	There is no mistake. The miracle is real.
2188	I530 hours- The Three Score and Ten will return any moment.
2189	What if they know... what ff they can tell by looking
2190	at me that I have been there?
2191	I could hide.
2192	No, there is no need to hide. God did not bring me this far and let me
2193	see what I have seen only to let me
2194	die at the hands of these poor children.
2195	I6I5 hours- The Three Score and Ten returned and went to their huts
2196	without giving me a glance.
2197	I sit here in the doorway of my own hut and cannot keep from smiling,
2198	from laughing, and from praying.
2199	Earlier I walked to the edge of the Cleft, said Mass, and took
2200	Communion. The villagers did not bother to watch.
2201	How soon can I leave? Supervisor Orlandi and Tuk had said that the
2202	flame forest was fully active for three local months - a hundred and
2203	twenty days - then relatively quiet for two. Tuk and I arrived here on
2204	Day $? ....
2205	I cannot wait another hundred days to bring the news to the world... to
2206	all of the worlds.
2207	If only a skimmer would brave the weather and flame forests and pluck me
2208	out of here. If only I could access one of the datafix sats that serve
2209	the plantations.
2210	Anything is possible. More miracles will occur.
2211	2350 hours- The Three Score and Ten have gone down into the Cleft. The
2212	voices of the evening wind choir are rising all around.
2213	How I wish I could be with them now! There, below.
2214	I will do the next best thing. I will drop to my knees here near the
2215	cliff edge and pray while the organ notes of the planet and sky sing
2216	what I now know is a hymn to a real and present God.
2217	Day i06:
2218	i awoke today to a perfect morning. The sky was a deep turquoise; the
2219	sun was a sharp, blood-red stone set within.
2220	I stood outside my hut as the mists cleared, the arboreals ended their
2221	morning screech concert, and the air began to warm. Then I went in and
2222	viewed my tapes and disks.
2223	I realize that in yesterday's excited scribblings I mentioned nothing of
2224	what I found down the cliff. I will do so now. I have the disks,
2225	filmtapes, and comlog notes, but there is always the chance that only
2226	these personal journals will be found.
2227	I lowered myself over the cliff edge at approximately 0730 hours
2228	yesterday morning. The Bikura were all foraging in the forest. The
2229	descent on vines had looked simple enough - they were bound around one
2230	another sufficiently to create a sort of ladder in most places - but as
2231	I swung out and began to let myself down, I could feel my heart pounding
2232	hard enough to be painful. There was a sheer three-thousand-meter drop
2233	to the rocks and river below. I kept a tight grip on at least two vines
2234	at all'times and centimetered my way down, trying not to look at the
2235	abyss beneath my feet.
2236	It took me the better part of an hour to descend the hundred and fifty
2237	meters that I am sure the Bikura can cover in ten minutes. Eventually I
2238	reached the curve of an overhang.
2239	Some vines trailed away into space but most of them curled under the
2240	sheer slab of rock toward the cliff wall thirty meters in. Here and
2241	there the vines 'appeared to have been braided to form crude bridges
2242	upon which the Bikura probably walked with little or no help from their
2243	hands. I crawled along these braided strands, clutching other vines for
2244	support and uttering prayers i had not said since my boyhood. I stared
2245	straight ahead as if ! could forget that there was only a seemingly
2246	infinite expanse of air under those swaying, creaking strands of
2247	vegetable matter.
2248	There was a broad ledge along the cliff wall. I allowed three meters of
2249	it to separate me from the gulf before i squeezed through the vines and
2250	dropped two and a half meters to the stone.
2251	The ledge was about five meters wide and it terminated a short distance
2252	to the northeast where the great mass of the overhang began. I followed
2253	a path along the ledge to the southwest and had gone twenty or thirty
2254	paces before I stopped in shock. It was a path. A path worn out of
2255	solid stone. Its shiny surface had been pushed centimeters below the
2256	level of the surrounding rock. Farther on, where the path descended a
2257	curving lip of ledge to a lower, wider level, steps had been cut into
2258	the stone but even these had been worn to the point that they seemed to
2259	sag in the middle.
2260	I sat down for a second as the impact of this simple fact struck me.
2261	Even four centuries of daily travel by the Three Score and Ten could not
2262	account for such erosion of solid rock. Someone or something had used
2263	this path long before the Bikura colonists crashed here.
2264	Someone or something had used this path for millennia.
2265	I stood and walked on. There was little noise except for the wind
2266	blowing gently along the half-kilometer-wide Cleft. I realized that I
2267	could hear the soft sound of the river far below.
2268	The path curved left around a section of cliff and ended. I stepped out
2269	onto a broad apron of gently descending stone and stared. I believe I
2270	made the sign of the cross without thinking.
2271	Because this ledge ran due north and south for a hundred-meter cut of
2272	cliff, I could look due west along a thirty-kilometer slash of Cleft to
2273	open sky where the plateau ended. I realized at once that the setting
2274	sun would illuminate this slab of cliff wall under the overhang each
2275	evening. It would not have surprised me if -on the spring or autumn
2276	solstice- Hyperion's sun would, from this vantage point, appear to set
2277	directly into the Cleft, its red sides just touching the pink-toned rock
2278	walls.
2279	I turned left and stared at the cliff face. The worn path led across
2280	the wide ledge to doors carved into the vertical slab of stone. No,
2281	these were not merely doors, they were portals, intricately carved
2282	portals with elaborate stone casements and lintels. To either side of
2283	these twin doors spread broad windows of stained glass, rising
2284	at least twenty meters toward the overhang. i went closer and inspected
2285	the facade. Whoever had built this had done so by widening the area
2286	under the overhang, slicing a sheer, smooth wail into the granite of the
2287	plateau, and then tunneling directly into the cliff face. l ran my hand
2288	over the deeply cut folds of ornamental carving around the door. Smooth.
2289	Everything had been smoothed and worn and softened by time, even here,
2290	hidden away from most of the elements by the protective lip of overhang.
2291	How many thousands of years had this... temple... been carved into the
2292	south wail of the Cleft?
2293	The stained glass was neither glass nor plastic but some thick,
2294	translucent substance that seemed as hard as the surrounding stone to
2295	the touch. Nor was the window a composite of panels; the colors
2296	swirled, shaded, melded, and blended into one another like oil on water.
2297	I removed my flashlight from the pack, touched one of the doors, and
2298	hesitated as the tail portai swung inward with frictionless ease.
2299	I entered the vestibule- there is no other word for it- crossed the
2300	silent ten-meter space, and paused in front of another wall made from
2301	the same stained-glass materiai that even now glowed behind me, filling
2302	the vestibule with thick light of a hundred subtle hues. I reaiized
2303	instantly that at the sunset hour the direct rays of the sun would fill
2304	this room with incredibly deep shafts of color, would strike the
2305	stained-glass wail in front of me, and would illuminate whatever lay
2306	beyond.
2307	I found the single door, outlined by thin, dark metal set into the
2308	stained-glass stone, and I passed through it.
2309	On Pacem we have - as best we could from ancient photos and holos-
2310	rebuilt the basilica of St Peter's exactly as it stood in the ancient
2311	Vatican. Almost seven hundred feet long and four hundred and fifty feet
2312	wide, the church can hold fifty thousand worshipers when His Holiness
2313	says Mass. We have never had more than five thousand faithful there
2314	even when the Council of Bishops of All the Worlds is in assembly every
2315	forty-three years. In the central apse near our copy of Bernini's
2316	Throne of St Peter, the great dome rises more than a hundred and thirty
2317	meters above the floor of the altar.
2318	It is an impressive space.
2319	This space was larger.
2320	In the dim light I used the beam of my flashlight to ascertain that !
2321	was in a single great room - a giant hall hollowed out of solid stone. I
2322	estimated that the smooth walls rose to a ceiling that must be only a
2323	few meters beneath the surface of the crag where the Bikura had set
2324	their huts. There was no ornamentation here, no furniture, no sign of
2325	any concession to form or function except for the object that sat
2326	squarely in the center of this huge, echoing cave of a room.
2327	Centered in the great hail was an altar - a five-meter-square slab of
2328	stone left when the rest was hollowed out - and from this altar rose a
2329	cross.
2330	Four meters high, three meters wide, carved in the old style of the
2331	elaborate crucifixes of Old Earth, the cross faced the stained-glass
2332	wall as if awaiting the sun and the explosion of light that would ignite
2333	the inlaid diamonds, sapphires, blood crystals, lapis beads, queen's
2334	tears, onyxes, and other precious stones that I could make out in the
2335	light of the flashlight as I approached.
2336	I knelt and prayed. Shutting off the flashlight, I waited several
2337	minutes before my eyes could discern the cross in the dim, smoky light.
2338	This was, without a doubt, the cruciform of which the Bikura spoke. And
2339	it had been set here a minimum of many thousands of years ago- perhaps
2340	tens of thousands- long before mankind first left Old Earth. Almost
2341	certainly before
2342	Christ taught in Galilee.
2343	I prayed.
2344	Today ! sit out in the sunlight after reviewing the holodisks. I have
2345	confirmed what I barely noticed during my return up the cliff after
2346	discovering what I now think of as 'the basilica." On the ledge outside
2347	the basilica there are steps descending farther into the Cleft.
2348	Although not as worn as the path leading to the basilica, they are
2349	equally intriguing. God alone knows what other wonders wait below.
2350	I must let the worlds know of this find!
2351	The irony of my being the one t°discover this is not lost on me. I f it
2352	had not been for Armaghast and my exile, this discovery might have
2353	waited more centuries. The Church might have died before this
2354	revelation could have brought new life to it.
2355	But I have found it.
2356	One way or the other, I will leave or get my message out.
2357	Day I07:
2358	I am a prisoner.
2359	This morning I was bathing in my usual place near where the stream drops
2360	over the cliff edge when I heard a sound and looked up to see the Bikura
2361	I call Del staring at me with wide eyes. I called a greeting but the
2362	little Bikura turned and ran. It was perplexing. They rarely hurry.
2363	Then I realized that even though I had been wearing trousers at the
2364	time, I had undoubtedly violated their nudity taboo by allowing Del to
2365	see me naked from the waist up.
2366	I smiled, shook my head, finished dressing, and returned to the village.
2367	If I- had known what awaited me there, I would not have been amused.
2368	The entire Three Score and Ten stood watching as I approached. I
2369	stopped a dozen paces from Al. 'Good morning,' I said.
2370	Alpha pointed and half a dozen of the Bikura lunged toward me, seized my
2371	arms and legs, and pinned me to the ground. Beta stepped forward and
2372	removed a sharp-edged stone from his or her robes. As I struggled in
2373	vain to pull free, Beta cut my clothes down the front and pulled apart
2374	the shreds until I was all but naked.
2375	I ceased struggling as the mob pressed forward. They stared at my pale,
2376	white body and murmured to themselves.
2377	I could feel my heart pounding. 'l am sorry if I have offended your
2378	laws,' I began, 'but there is no reason..."
2379	'Silence,' said Alpha and spoke to the talt Bikura with the scar on his
2380	palm - the one I call Zed. 'He is notof the cruciform."
2381	Zed nodded.
2382	'Let me explain,' i began again, but Alpha silenced me
2383	with a backhanded slap that left my lip bleeding and my ears ringing.
2384	There had been no more sense of hostility in his action than i would
2385	have shown in silencing a comlog by throwing a switch.
2386	'What are we to do with him?" asked Alpha.
2387	'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' said Beta
2388	and the crowd shifted forward. Many had sharpened stones in their
2389	hands. 'Those not of the cruciform must die the true death,' said Beta
2390	and her voice held the tone of complacent finality common to
2391	oft-repeated formulae and religious litanies.
2392	'l follow the cross!" I cried out as the crowd tugged me to my feet. I
2393	grabbed at the crucifix that hung around my neck and struggled against
2394	the pressure of many arms. Finally I managed to lift the little cross
2395	over my head.
2396	Alpha held up his hand and the crowd paused. In the sudden silence I
2397	could hear the river three kilometers below in the Cleft. 'He does
2398	carry a cross,' said Alpha.
2399	Del pressed forward. 'But he is not of the cruciform! I saw. It was
2400	not as we thought. He is not of the cruciform!" There was murder in his
2401	voice.
2402	I cursed myself for being careless and stupid. The future of the Church
2403	depended upon my survival and l had thrown both away by beguiling myself
2404	into believing that the Bikura were dull, harmless children.
2405	'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' repeated
2406	Beta. It was a final sentencing.
2407	Stones were being raised by seventy hands when l shouted, knowing that
2408	it was either my last chance or my final condemnation. 'i have been
2409	down the cliff and worshiped at your altar! i follow the cross!'
2410	Alpha and the mob hesitated. I could see that they were wrestling with
2411	this new thought. It was not easy for them.
2412	'! follow the cross and wish to be of the cruciform,' !
2413	said as calmly as I could. '! have been to your altar."
2414	'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' called
2415	Gamma.
2416	'But he follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'He has prayed in the room."
2417	'This cannot be,' said Zed. 'The Three Score and Ten pray there and he
2418	is not of the Three Score and Ten."
2419	'We knew before this that he is not of the Three Score and Ten,' said
2420	Alpha, frowning slightly as he dealt with the concept of past tense.
2421	'He is not of the cruciform,' said Delta-two.
2422	'Those who are not of the cruciform must die the true death,' said Beta.
2423	'He follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'Can he not then become of the
2424	cruciform?"
2425	An outcry arose. In the general babble and shuffle of forms I pulled
2426	against restraining hands but their grips remained firm.
2427	'He is not of the Three Score and Ten and is not of the cruciform,' said
2428	Beta, sounding more puttied than hostile now. 'How is it that he should
2429	not die the true death?
2430	We must take the stones and open his throat so that the blood flows
2431	until his heart stops. He is not of the cruciform."
2432	'He follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'Can he not become of the
2433	cruciform?"
2434	This time silence followed the question.
2435	'He follows the cross and has prayed at the room of the cruciform,' said
2436	Alpha, 'He must not die the true death."
2437	'All die the true death,' said a Bikura whom I did not recognize. My
2438	arms were aching from the strain of holding the crucifix above my head.
2439	'Except the Three Score and Ten,' finished the anonymous Bikura.
2440	'Because they followed the cross, prayed at the room, and became of the
2441	cruciform,' said Alpha. 'Must he not then become of the cruciform?"
2442	I stood there gripping the cold metal of the small cross and awaited
2443	their verdict. I was afraid to die - l felt afraid - but the larger
2444	part of my mind seemed almost detached. My greatest regret was that I
2445	would not be able to send out the news of the basilica to an unbelieving
2446	universe.
2447	'Come, we will talk of this,' Beta said to the group and they pulled me
2448	with them as they trod silently back to the village.
2449	They have imprisoned me here in my hut. There was no chance to try for
2450	the hunting maser; several of them held me down while they emptied the
2451	hut of most of my possessions. They took my clothing, leaving me only
2452	one of their rough-woven robes to cover myself with.
2453	The longer I sit here the more angry and anxious I become. They have
2454	taken my comlog, imager, disks, chips... everything. I have a single,
2455	unopened crate of medical diagnostic equipment left up at the old site,
2456	but that cannot help me document the miracle in the Cleft. If they
2457	destroy the things they have taken- and then
2458	destroy me - there will be no record of the basilica.
2459	If I had a weapon I could kill the guards and
2460	Oh dear God what am I thinking? Edouard, what am I to do?
2461	And even if I survive this- make my way back to Keats- arrange travel
2462	back to the Web- who would believe me?-'after nine years' absence from
2463	Pacem because of the quantum-leap time-debt- just an old man returning
2464	with the same lies he was exiled for- Oh, dear God, if they destroy the
2465	data let them destroy me as well.
2466	Day II0:
2467	' After three days they have decided my fate.
2468	Zed and the one I think of as Theta-Prime came to get me shortly after
2469	midday. I blinked as they led me out into the light. The Three Score
2470	and Ten stood in a wide.
2471	semicircle near the cliff edge. I fully expected to be thrown over that
2472	edge. Then I noticed the bonfire.
2473	I had assumed that the Bikura were so primitive that they had lost the
2474	art of making and using fire. They did not warm themselves with fire
2475	and their huts were always dark. I had never seen them cook a meal, not
2476	even the rare corpse of an arboreal they devoured. But now the fire was
2477	burning strongly and they were the only ones who could have started it.
2478	I looked to see what fueled the flames.
2479	They were burning my clothes, my comiog, my field
2480	notes, the tape cassettes,- video chips, data disks, the imager ...
2481	everything that had held information. I screamed at them, tried to
2482	throw myself at the fire, and called them names I had not used since the
2483	street days of my childhood. They ignored me.
2484	Finally Alpha came close. 'Yu will become of the cruciform,' he said
2485	softly.
2486	I did not care. They led me back to my hut where l wept for an hour.
2487	There is no guard at the door. A minute ago I stood at the doorway and
2488	considered running for the flame forests. Then I thought of a much
2489	shorter but no less fatal run to the Cleft.
2490	I did nothing.
2491	The sun will be setting in a short time. Already the winds are rising.
2492	Soon. Soon.
2493	Day II2:
2494	Has it been only two days? It has been forever.
2495	It did not come off this morning. It did not come off.
2496	The medscanner's image wafer is right here in front of me but I Still
2497	cannot believe it. And yet I do. I am of the cruciform now.
2498	They came for me just before sunset. All of them. I did not struggle
2499	as they led me to the edge of the Cleft.
2500	They were more agile on the vines than I could have imagined. I slowed
2501	them down but they were patient, showing me the easiest footholds, the
2502	fastest route.
2503	Hyperion's sun had dropped below low clouds and was visible above the
2504	rim wall to the west as we walked the final few meters to the basilica.
2505	The evening windsong was louder than I had anticipated; it was as if we
2506	were caught amid the pipes of a gigantic church organ. The notes rose
2507	from bass growls so deep that my bones and teeth resonated in sympathy
2508	to high, piercing screams that slid easily into the ultrasonic.
2509	Alpha opened the outer doors and we passed through the antechamber into
2510	the central basilica. The Three Score and Ten made a wide circle around
2511	the altar and its tall cross. There was no litany. There was no
2512	singing.
2513	There was no ceremony. We simply stood there in silence as the wind
2514	roared through the fluted columns outside and echoed in the great empty
2515	room carved into the stone - echoed and resonated and grew in volume
2516	until I clapped my hands over my ears. And all the while the streaming,
2517	horizontal rays of sunlight f'dled the hall with deepening hues of
2518	amber, gold, lapis, and then amber again- colors so deep that they made
2519	the air thick with light and lay like paint against the skin. l watched
2520	as the cross caught this light and held it in each of its thousand
2521	precious stones, held it- it seemed - even after the sun had set and the
2522	windows had faded to a twilight gray. It was as if the great crucifix
2523	had absorbed the light and was radiating it toward us, into us. Then
2524	even the cross was dark and the winds died and in the sudden dimness
2525	Alpha said softly, 'Bring him along."
2526	We emerged onto the wide ledge of stone and Beta was there with torches.
2527	As Beta passed them out to a selected few, I wondered if the Bikura
2528	reserved fire for ritual purposes only. Then Beta was leading the way
2529	and we descended the narrow staircase carved into the stone.
2530	At first I crept along, terrified, clutching at the smooth rock and
2531	searching for any reassuring projection of root or stone. The drop to
2532	our right was so sheer and endless that it bordered on being absurd.
2533	Descending the ancient staircase was far worse than clutching at vines
2534	on the cliff face above. Here I had to look down each time I placed a
2535	foot on the narrow, age-slickened slabs. A slip and fall at first
2536	seemed probable, then inevitable.
2537	I had the urge to stop then, to return at least to the safety of the
2538	basilica, but most of the Three Score and Ten were behind me on the
2539	narrow staircase and there seemed little chance that they would stand
2540	aside to let me pass. Besides this, and even greater than my fear, was
2541	the nagging curiosity about what was at the bottom of the staircase. I
2542	did pause long enough to glance up at the .
2543	lip of the Cleft three hundred meters above and to see
2544	that the clouds were gone, the stars were out, and the nightly ballet of
2545	meteor trails was bright against a sable sky. Then I lowered my head,
2546	began a whispered recitation
2547	of the rosary, and followed the torchlight and the Bikura into the
2548	treacherous depths.
2549	I could not believe that the staircase would take us all the way to the
2550	bottom of the Cleft, but it did. When, sometime after midnight, I
2551	realized that we would be descending all the way down to the level of
2552	the river, I estimated that it would take us until noon of the next day,
2553	but it did not.
2554	We reached the base of the Cleft shortly before sunrise. The stars
2555	still shone in the aperture of sky between cliff walls that rose an
2556	impossible distance on either side. Exhausted, staggering downward step
2557	by step, recognizing slowly that there were no more steps, I stared
2558	upward and wondered stupidly if the stars remained visible there in the
2559	daylight as they did in a well I had lowered myself into once as a child
2560	in Villefranche-sur-SaSne.
2561	'Here,' said Beta. It was the first word uttered in many hours and was
2562	barely audible over the roar of the river. The Three Score and Ten
2563	stopped where they were and stood motionless. I collapsed to my knees
2564	and fell on my side. There was no possibility that I could climb that
2565	stairway we had just descended. Not in a day. Not in a week. Perhaps
2566	never. l closed my eyes to sleep but the dull fuel of nervous tension
2567	continued to burn inside me. I looked out across the floor of the
2568	ravine. The river here was wider than I had anticipated, at least
2569	seventy meters across, and the noise of it was beyond mere noise; I felt
2570	that I was being consumed by a great beast's roar.
2571	I sat up and stared at a patch of darkness in the opposing cliff wall.
2572	It was a shadow darker than the shadows, more regular than the serrated
2573	patchwork of buttresses and crevices and columns that mottled the face
2574	of the cliff. it was a perfect square of darkness, at least thirty
2575	meters to a side. A door or hole in the cliff wall. I struggled to my
2576	feet and looked downriver along the wall we had just descended; yes, it
2577	was there. The other entrance, the one toward which Beta and the others
2578	even now were walking, was faintly visible in the starlight.
2579	l had found an entrance to Hyperion's labyrinth.
2580	'Did you know that Hyperion was one of the nine labyrinthine worlds?"
2581	someone had asked me on the dropship. Yes, it was the young priest
2582	named Hoyt. l had said yes and dismissed the fact. I was interested in
2583	the Bikura - actually more in the self-inflicted pain of my own exile -
2584	not the labyrinths or their builders.
2585	Nine worlds have labyrinths. Nine out of a hundred seventy-six
2586	Webworlds and another two hundred-some colonial and protectorate
2587	planets. Nine worlds out of eight thousand or more worlds explored -
2588	however cursorily - since the Hegira.
2589	There are planetary archaeohistorians who devote their lives to the
2590	study of the labyrinths. Not I. I had always found them a sterile
2591	topic, vaguely unreal. Now I walked toward one with the Three Score and
2592	Ten as the Kans River roared and vibrated and threatened to douse our
2593	torches with its spray.
2594	The labyrinths were dug ... tunneled ... created more than three
2595	quarters of a million standard years ago. The details were inevitably
2596	the same, their origins inevitably unsoived.
2597	Labyrinthine worlds are always Earthlike, at least to 7.9 on the Solmev
2598	Scale, always circling a G-type star, and yet always restricted to
2599	worlds that are tectonically dead, more like Mars than Old Earth. The
2600	tunnels themselves are set deep- usually a minimum of ten kilometers but
2601	often as deep as thirty - and they catacomb the crust of the planet. On
2602	Svoboda, not far from Pacem's system, over eight hundred thousand
2603	kilometers of labyrinth have been explored by remotes.
2604	The tunnels on each world are thirty meters square and carved by some
2605	technology still not available to the Hegemony. I read once in an
2606	archaeological journal that Kemp-HS!tzer and Weinstein had postulated a
2607	'fusion tunneler' that would explain the perfectly smooth walls and lack
2608	of tailings, but their theory did not explain where the Builders or
2609	their machines had come from or why they had devoted centuries to such
2610	an apparently aimless engineering task. Each of the labyrinthine
2611	worlds- including Hyperion- has been probed and researched. Nothing has
2612	ever been found. No signs of
2613	excavation machinery, no rusting miners' helmets, not a single piece of
2614	shattered plastic or decomposing stimstick wrapper. Researchers have
2615	not even identified entrance and exit shafts. No suggestion of heavy
2616	metals or precious ores has been sufficient to explain such a monumental
2617	effort. No legend or artifact of the Labyrinth Builders has survived.
2618	The mystery had mildly intrigued me over the years but never concerned
2619	me.
2620	Until now.
2621	We entered the tunnel mouth. It was not a perfect square. Erosion and
2622	gravity had turned the perfect tunnel into a rough cave for a hundred
2623	meters into the cliff wall. Beta stopped just where the tunnel floor
2624	grew smooth and extinguished his torch. The other Bikura did likewise.
2625	It was very dark. The tunnel had turned enough to block out any
2626	starlight that might have entered. I had been in caves before. With
2627	the torches extinguished, I did not expect my eyes to adapt to the
2628	near-total darkness.
2629	But they did.
2630	Within thirty seconds I began to sense a roseate glow, dim at first,
2631	then ever richer until the cave was brighter than the canyon had been,
2632	brighter than Pacem under the glow of its triune moons. The light came
2633	from a hundred sources- a thousand sources. I was able to make out the
2634	nature of these sources just as the Bikura dropped reverently to their
2635	knees.
2636	The cave walls and ceiling were encrusted with crosses ranging in size
2637	from a few millimeters to almost a meter long. Each glowed with a deep,
2638	pink light of its own.
2639	Invisible in the torchlight, these glowing crosses now suffused the
2640	tunnel with light. I approached one embedded in the wall nearest me.
2641	Thirty or so centimeters across, it pulsed with a soft, organic flow.
2642	This was not something that had been carved out of stone or attached to
2643	the wall; it was definitely organic, definitely alive, resembling soft
2644	coral. It was slightly warm to the touch.
2645	There came the slightest whisper of sound - no, not sound, a disturbance
2646	in the cool air, perhaps - and I turned in time to see something enter
2647	the chamber.
2648	The Bikura were still kneeling, their heads down, eyes lowered. I
2649	remained standing. My gaze never left the thing which moved among the
2650	kneeling Bikura.
2651	It was vaguely man-shaped but in no way human. It stood at least three
2652	meters tall. Even when it was at rest, the silvered surface of the
2653	thing seemed to shift and flow like mercury suspended in midair. The
2654	reddish glow from the crosses set into the tunnel walls reflected from
2655	sharp surfaces and glinted on the curved metal blades protruding from
2656	the thing's forehead, four wrists, oddly jointed elbows, knees, armored
2657	back, and thorax. It flowed between the kneeling Bikura, and when it
2658	extended four long arms, hands extended but fingers clicking into place
2659	like chrome scalpels, I was absurdly reminded of His Holiness on Pacem
2660	offering a benediction to the faithful.
2661	I had no doubt that I was looking at the legendary Shrike.
2662	At that moment I must have moved or made a sound, for large red eyes
2663	turned my way and I found myself hypnotized by the dance of light within
2664	the multifaceted prisms there: not merely reflected light but a fierce,
2665	blood-bright glow which seemed to burn within the creature's barbed
2666	skull and pulse in the terrible gems set where God meant eyes to be.
2667	Then it moved ... or, rather, it did not move but ceased being there
2668	and was here, leaning less than a meter from me, its oddly jointed arms
2669	encircling me in a fence of body-blades and liquid silver steel. Panting
2670	hard but unable to take a breath, I saw my own reflection, face white
2671	and distorted, dancing across the surface of the thing's metallic shell
2672	and burning eyes.
2673	I confess that I felt something closer to exaltation than fear.
2674	Something inexplicable was happening. Forged in Jesuit logic and
2675	tempered in the cold bath of science, !
2676	nevertheless understood at that second the ancient obsession of the
2677	God-fearing for another kind of fear: the thrill of exorcism, the
2678	mindless whirl of Dervish possession, the puppet-dance ritual of Tarot,
2679	and the almost erotic surrender of sance, speaking in tongues, and Zen
2680	Gnostic trance. I realized at that instant just
2681	how surely the affirmation of demons or the summoning of Satan somehow
2682	can affirm the reality of their mystic antithesis - the God of Abraham.
2683	Thinking none of this but feeling all of it, I awaited the embrace of
2684	the Shrike with the imperceptible tremble of a virgin bride.
2685	It disappeared.
2686	There was no thunderclap, no sudden smell of brimstone, not even a
2687	scientifically sound inrush of air. One second the thing was there,
2688	surrounding me with its beautiful certainty of sharp-edged death, and
2689	the next instant it was gone.
2690	Numbed, I stood there and blinked as Alpha rose and approached me in the
2691	Bosch-tinted gloom. He stood where the Shrike had stood, his own arms
2692	extended in a pathetic imitation of the deadly perfection I had just
2693	witnessed, but there was no sign on Alpha's bland, Bikura face that he
2694	had seen the creature. He made an awkward, open-handed gesture which
2695	seemed to include the labyrinth, cave wall, and scores of glowing
2696	crosses embedded there.
2697	'Cruciform,' said Alpha. The Three Score and Ten rose, came closer, and
2698	knelt again. I looked at their placid faces in the soft light and I
2699	also knelt.
2700	'You will follow the cross all of your days,' said Alpha, and his voice
2701	carried the cadence of litany. The rest of the Bikura repeated the
2702	statement in a tone just short of a chant.
2703	'You wR! be of the cruciform all of your days,' said Alpha, and as the
2704	others repeated this he reached out and pulled a small cruciform away
2705	from the cave wall. It was not more than a dozen centimeters long and
2706	it came away from the wall with the faintest of snaps. Its glow faded
2707	even as I watched. Alpha removed a small thong from his robe, tied it
2708	around small knobs at the top of the cruciform, and held the cross above
2709	my head. 'You
2710	will be of the cruciform now and forever,' he said.
2711	'Now and forever,' echoed the Bikura.
2712	'Amen,' I whispered.
2713	Beta signaled that I should open the front of my robe.
2714	Alpha lowered the-small cross until it hung around my
2715	neck. It eit cool against my chest; the back of it was perfectly flat,
2716	perfectly smooth.
2717	The Bikura stood and wandered toward the cave entrance, apparently
2718	apathetic and indifferent once again. I watched them leave and then I
2719	gingerly touched the cross, lifted and inspected it. The cruciform was
2720	cool, inert. If it had truly been living a few seconds earlier, it
2721	showed no sign of it now. It continued to feel more like coral than
2722	crystal or rock; there was no sign of any adhesive material on the
2723	smooth back of it. I speculated on photochemical effects that would
2724	have created the luminescent quality. I speculated on natural phos-
2725	phors, bioluminescence, and on the chances that evolution would shape
2726	such things. I speculated on what, if anything, their presence here had
2727	to do with the labyrinth and on the aeons necessary to raise this
2728	plateau so the river and canyon could slice through one of the tunnels.
2729	I speculated on the basilica and its makers, on the Bikura, on the
2730	Shrike, and on myself. Eventually I ceased speculating and closed my
2731	eyes to pray.
2732	When I emerged from the cave, the cruciform cool against my chest under
2733	the robe, the Three Score and Ten were .obviously ready to begin the
2734	three-kilometer climb up the staircase. I looked up to'see a pale slash
2735	of morning sky between the walls of the Cleft.
2736	'No!" I shouted, my voice almost lost against the roar of the river. 'I
2737	need rest. Rest!" I sank to my knees on the sand but half a dozen of
2738	the Bikura approached, pulled me gently to my feet, and moved me toward
2739	the staircase.
2740	I tried, the Lord knows that I tried, but two or three hours into the
2741	climb I felt my legs give way and I collapsed, sliding across the rock,
2742	unable to stop my six-hundred-meter fall to the rocks and river. I
2743	remember grasping at the cruciform under the thick robe and then half a
2744	dozen hands stopped my slide, lifted me, carried me. Then I remember no
2745	more.
2746	Until this morning. I woke to a sunrise pouring light through the
2747	opening of my hut. I wore only the robe and a touch assured me that the
2748	cruciform was still hanging from its fibrous thong. As I watched the
2749	sun lift over the
2750	forest, I realized that I had lost a day, that somehow I had slept
2751	through not only my ascent up that endless staircase (how could these
2752	little people carry me two and a half vertical kilometers?) but through
2753	the next day and night as well·
2754	I looked around my hut. My comlog and other recording devices were
2755	gone. Only my medscanner and a few packets of anthropological software
2756	made useless by the destruction of my other equipment remained. I shook
2757	my head and went up to the stream to wash.
2758	The Bikura appeared to be sleeping. Now that I had participated in
2759	their ritual and 'become of the cruciform,' they seemed to have lost
2760	interest in me. As I stripped to bathe, I decided to take no interest
2761	in them. I decided that I would leave as soon as I was strong enough. I
2762	would find a way around the flame forests if necessary. I could descend
2763	the staircase and follow the Kans if I had to. I knew more than ever
2764	that word of these miraculous artifacts had to be brought to the outside
2765	world.
2766	I pulled off the heavy robe, stood pale and shivering in the morning
2767	light, and went to lift the small cruciform from my chest.
2768	It did not come off.
2769	It lay there as if it were part of my flesh. I pulled, scraped, and
2770	tore at the thong until it snapped and fell away. I clawed at the
2771	cross-shaped lump on my chest. It did not come off. It was as if my
2772	flesh had sealed itself around the edges of the cruciform. Except for
2773	the scratches from my fingernails, there was no pain or physical
2774	sensation in the cruciform or surrounding flesh, only sheer terror in my
2775	soul at the thought of this thing attached to me. After the first rush
2776	of panic subsided, I sat a minute and then hastily pulled on my robe and
2777	ran back to the village.
2778	My knife was gone, my maser, scissors, razor - everything that might
2779	have helped me peel back the growth on my chest. My nails left bloody
2780	tracks across the red welt and my chest. Then I remembered the
2781	medscanner. I passed the transceiver over my chest, read the diskey
2782	display, shook my head in disbelief, and then ran an entire body scan.
2783	After a while I keyed in a request for hard copies of the scan results
2784	and sat motionless for a very long time..
2785	I sit here now holding the image wafers. The cruciform is quite visible
2786	on both the sonic and k-cross images ·.. as are the internal fibers
2787	that spread like thin tentacles, like roots, throughout my body.
2788	Excess ganglia radiate from a thick nucleus above my sternum to
2789	filaments everywhere- a nightmare of nematodes. As well as I can tell
2790	with my simple field scanner, the nematodes terminate in the amygdala
2791	and other basal ganglia in each cerebral hemisphere. My temperature,
2792	metabolism, and !ymphocyte level are normal.
2793	There has been no invasion of foreign tissue.
2794	According to the scanner, the nematodic filaments are the result of
2795	extensive but simple metastasis. According to the scanner, the
2796	cruciform itself is composed of familiar tissue... the DNA is mine.
2797	I am of the cruciform.
2798	Day II6:
2799	Each day I pace the confines of my cage - the flame · forests to the
2800	south and east, the forested ravines to the northeast, and the Cleft to
2801	the north and west. The Three Score and Ten will not let me descend
2802	into the Cleft beyond the basilica. The cruciform will not let me get
2803	more than ten kilometers from the Cleft.
2804	At first I could not believe this. I had resolved to enter the flame
2805	forests, trusting to luck and to God's help to see me through. But I
2806	had gone no more than two kilometers into the fringes of the forest when
2807	pain struck me in the chest and arms and head. I was sure that !-was
2808	having a massive heart attack. But as soon as i turned back toward the
2809	Cleft the symptoms ceased. I experimented for some time and the results
2810	were invariably the same. Whenever I ventured deeper into the flame
2811	forest, away from the Cleft, the pain would return and increase in
2812	severity until I turned back.
2813	I begin to understand other things. 'Yesterday I
2814	happened across the wreckage of the original seedship shuttle as I
2815	explored to the north. Only a rusted, vine-enmeshed wreck of' metal
2816	remains among the rocks at the edge of the flame forest near the ravine.
2817	But crouching among the exposed alloy ribs of the ancient craft, I could
2818	imagine the rejoicing of the seventy survivors, their short voyage to
2819	the Cleft, their eventual discovery of the basilica, and ... and what?
2820	Conjectures beyond that point are useless, but suspicions remain.
2821	Tomorrow I will attempt another physical exam of one of the Bikura.
2822	Perhaps now that I am 'of the cruciform' they will allow it.
2823	Each day I do a reedscan of myself. The nematodes remain - perhaps
2824	thicker, perhaps not. l am convinced that they are purely parasitic
2825	although my body has shown no signs of this. I peer at my face in the
2826	pool near the waterfall and see only the same long, aging countenance
2827	that I have learned to dislike in recent years: This niorning, while
2828	gazing at my image in the water, l opened my mouth wide, half thinking
2829	that I would see gray filaments and nematode clusters growing from the
2830	roof of my mouth and the back of my throat. There was nothing.
2831	Day liT:
2832	The Bikura are sexless. Not celibate or herma-phroditic or undeveloped
2833	- sexless. They are as devoid of external or internal genitalia as a
2834	child's flowfoam doll. There is no evidence that the penis or testes or
2835	comparable female organs have atrophied or been surgically altered.
2836	There is no sign that they ever existed.
2837	Urine is conducted through a primitive urethra terminating in a small
2838	chamber contiguous with the anus - a sort of crude cloaca.
2839	Beta allowed the examination. The reedscanner confirmed what my eyes
2840	would not believe. Del and Theta also agreed to be scanned. I have
2841	absolutely no doubt that the rest of the Three Score and Ten are equally
2842	sexless. There is no sign that they have been... altered.
2843	i would suggest that they had all been born that way but from what kind
2844	of parents?. And how do these sexless lumps of human clay plan to
2845	reproduce? It must be tied in with the cruciform in some way.
2846	When I was finished with their medscans I stripped and studied myself.
2847	The cruciform rises from my chest like pink scar tissue, but I am still
2848	a man.
2849	For how long?
2850	Day I33:
2851	Alpha is dead.
2852	I was with him three mornings ago when he fell. We were about three
2853	kilometers east, hunting for chalma tubers in the large boulders near
2854	the edge of the Cleft. It had been raining most of the past two days
2855	and the rocks were quite slippery. I looked up from my own scrambling
2856	just in time to see Alpha lose his footing and go sliding down a broad
2857	slab of stone, over the edge. He did not shout. The only sound was the
2858	rasp of his robe against the rock, followed several seconds later by the
2859	sickening dropped-melon sound of his body striking a ledge eighty meters
2860	below.
2861	It took me an hour to find a route down to him. Even before I began the
2862	treacherous descent I knew it was too late to help. But it was my duty.
2863	Alpha's body was half wedged between two large rocks. He must have died
2864	instantly; his arms and legs were splintered and the right side of his
2865	skull had been crushed. Blood and brain tissue clung to the wet rock
2866	like the refuse of a sad picnic. I wept as I stood over the little
2867	body. I do not know why I wept, but I did. And as l wept I
2868	administered Extreme Unction and prayed that God would accept the soul
2869	of this poor, sexless little person. Later I wrapped the body in vines,
2870	laboriously climbed the eighty meters of cliff, and - pausing frequently
2871	to pant with exhaustion- pulled the broken corpse up to me.
2872	There was little interest as I carried the body of Alpha into the Bikura
2873	village. Eventually Beta and half a dozen
2874	others wandered over to stare down indifferently at the corpse. No one
2875	asked me how he had died. After a few minutes the small crowd
2876	dispersed.
2877	Later l'carried Alpha's body to the promontory where I had buried Tuk so
2878	many weeks earlier. I was digging the shallow grave with a flat stone
2879	when Gamma appeared. The Bikura's eyes widened and for a brief second I
2880	thought I saw emotion cross those bland features.
2881	'What are you doing?" asked Gamma.
2882	'Burying him." I was too tired to say more. I leaned against a thick
2883	chalma root and rested.
2884	'No." It was a command. 'He is of the cruciform."
2885	I stared as Gamma turned and walked quickly back to the village. When
2886	the Bikura was gone, I pulled off the crude fiber tarp I had draped over
2887	the corpse.
2888	Alpha was, without any doubt, truly dead. It no longer mattered to him
2889	or the universe whether he was of the cruciform or not. The fall had
2890	stripped him of most of his clothes and all of his dignity. The right
2891	side of his skull had been cracked and emptied like a breakfast egg.
2892	One eye stared sightlessly toward Hyperion's sky through a thickening
2893	film while the other looked out lazily from under a drooping lid. His
2894	rib cage had been splintered so thoroughly that shards of bone protruded
2895	from his flesh. Both arms were broken and his left leg had been twisted
2896	almost off. I had used the medscanner to perform a perfunctory autopsy
2897	and it had revealed massive internal injuries; even the poor devil's
2898	heart had been pulped by the force of the fall.
2899	I reached out and touched the cold flesh. Rigor mortis was setting in.
2900	My fingers brushed across the cross-shaped welt on his chest and I
2901	quickly pulled. my hand
2902	away. The cruciform was warm.
2903	'Stand away."
2904	I looked up to see Beta and the rest of the Bikura standing there. I
2905	had no doubt that they would murder me in a second if I did not move
2906	away from the corpse.
2907	As I did so, an idiotically frightened part of my mind noted that the
2908	Three Score and Ten were now the Three Score and Nine. It seemed funny
2909	at the time.
2910	The Bikura lifted the body and moved back toward the village. Beta
2911	looked at the sky, looked at me, and said:
2912	'It is almost time. You will come."
2913	We went down into the Cleft. The body was carefully tied into a basket
2914	of vines and lowered with us.
2915	The sun was not yet illuminating the interior of the basilica when they
2916	set Alpha's corpse on the broad altar and removed his remaining rags.
2917	I do not know what I expected next - some ritual act of cannibalism
2918	perhaps. Nothing would have surprised me. Instead, one of the Bikura
2919	raised his arms, just as the first shafts of colored light entered the
2920	basilica, and intoned, 'You will follow the cross all of your days."
2921	The Three Score and Nine knelt and repeated the sentence. I remained
2922	standing. I did not speak.
2923	'You will be of the cruciform all of your days,' said the little Bikura
2924	and the basilica echoed to the chorus of voices repeating the phrase.
2925	Light the color and texture of clotting blood threw a huge shadow of the
2926	cross on the far wall.
2927	'You will be of the cruciform now and forever and ever,' came the chant
2928	as the winds rose outside and the organ pipes of the canyon wailed with
2929	the voice of a tortured child.
2930	When the Bikura stopped chanting I did not whisper 'Amen." I stood there
2931	while the others turned and left with the sudden, total indifference of
2932	spoiled children who have lost interest in their game.
2933	'There is no reason to stay,' said Beta when the others had gone.
2934	'l want to,' I said, expecting a command to leave. Beta turned without
2935	so much as a shrug and left me there. The light dimmed. I went outside
2936	to watch the sun set and when I returned it had begun.
2937	Once, years ago in school, I saw a time-lapse holo showing the
2938	decomposition of a kangaroo mouse. A week's slow work of nature's
2939	recycling had been accelerated to thirty seconds of horror. There was
2940	the sudden, almost comic bloating of the little corpse, then the
2941	stretching of flesh into lesions, followed by the sudden
2942	appearance of maggots in the mouth, eyes, and open sores, and finally
2943	the sudden and incredible corkscrew cleaning of meat from the bones-
2944	there is no other phrase that fits the image- as the pack of maggots
2945	spiraled right to left, head to tail, in a time-lapsed helix of carrion
2946	consumption that left behind nothing but bones and gristle and hide.
2947	Now it was a man's body I watched.
2948	I stopped and stared, the last of the light fading quickly. There was
2949	no sound in the echoing silence of the basilica except for the pounding
2950	of my pulse in my own ears. I stared as Alpha's corpse 'first twitched
2951	and then visibly vibrated, almost !evitating off the altar in the
2952	spastic violence of sudden decomposition. For a few seconds the
2953	cruciform seemed to increase in size and deepen in color, glowing as red
2954	as raw meat, and I imagined then that I caught a glimpse of the network
2955	of filaments and nematodes holding the disintegrating body together like
2956	metal fibers in a sculptor's melting model. Theflesh flowed.
2957	I stayed in the basilica that night. The area around the altar remained
2958	!it by the glow of the cruciform on Alpha's chest. When the corpse
2959	moved the light would cast strange shadows on the walls.
2960	I did not leave the basilica until Alpha left on the third day, but most
2961	of the visible changes had taken place by the end of that first night.
2962	The body of the Bikura I had named .Alpha was broken down and rebuilt as
2963	I watched. The corpse t.hat was left was not quite Alpha and not quite
2964	not Alpha, but it was intact. The face was a flowfoam do!l's face,
2965	smooth and unlined, features stamped in a slight smile. At sunrise of
2966	the third day, i saw the corpse's chest begin to rise and fall and I
2967	heard the first intake of breath- a rasp like water being poured into a
2968	leather pouch. Shortly before noon I left
2969	the basilica to climb the vines.
2970	I followed Alpha.
2971	He has not spoken, will not reply. His eyes have a fixed, unfocused
2972	look and occasionally he pauses as if he hears distant voices calling.
2973	No one paid attention to us when we returned to the
2974	village. Alpha went to a hut and sits there now. I sit in mine. A
2975	minute ago I opened my robe and ran my fingers across the welt of the
2976	cruciform. It lies benignly under the flesh of my chest. Waiting.
2977	Day I40:
2978	I am recovering from my wounds and the loss of blood. It cannot be cut
2979	out with a sharpened stone.
2980	It does not like pain. I lost consciousness long before the pain or
2981	loss of blood demanded it. Each time I awoke and resumed cutting, I
2982	would be made to pass out. It does not like pain.
2983	Day I58:
2984	Alpha speaks some now. He seems duller, slower, and only vaguely aware
2985	of me (or anyone else) but he eats and moves. He appears to recognize
2986	me to some extent.
2987	The reedscanner shows the heart and internal organs of a young man -
2988	perhaps of a boy of sixteen.
2989	I must walt about another Hyperion month and ten days-about fifty days
2990	in all- until the flame fores become quiet enough for me to try to walk
2991	out, pain or no pain. We will see who can stand the most
2992	pain.
2993	Day I73:
2994	Another death.
2995	The one called Will - the one with the broken finger - had been missing
2996	for a week. Yesterday the Bikura went several kilometers northeast as
2997	if following a beacon, and found the remains near the great ravine.
2998	Evidently a branch had snapped while he was climbing to grasp some
2999	¢halma fronds. Death must have been instantaneous when he broke his
3000	neck, but it is where he fell that is important. The body - if one
3001	could call it
3002	that - was lying between two great mud cones marking the burrows of the
3003	large red insects that Tuk called fire mnntises. Carpet beetles might
3004	have been a more apt phrase. In the past few days the insects had
3005	stripped the c6rpse clean to the bone. Little was left to be found
3006	except the skeleton, some random shreds of tissue and tendon, and the
3007	cruciform - still attached to the rib cage like some splendid cross
3008	packed in the sarcophagus of a long-dead pope.
3009	It is terrible, but I cannot help but feel some small sense of triumph
3010	beneath the sadness. There is no way thai the cruciform can regenerate
3011	something out of these bare bones; even the terrible illogic of this
3012	accursed parasite must respect the imperative of the law of conservation
3013	of mass. The Bikura I called Will has died the true death. The Three
3014	Score and Ten truly are the Three Score and Nine from this time on.
3015	Day I74:
3016	I am a fool.
3017	Today I inquired about Will, about his dying the true death. I was
3018	curious at the lack of reaction from the Bikura. They had retrieved the
3019	cruciform but left the skeleton lying where they had found it; there was
3020	no attempt to carry the remains to the basilica. During the night I had
3021	become concerned that I would be made to fill the roll of the missing
3022	member of the Three Score and Ten. 'It is very sad,' I said, 'that one
3023	of you has died the true death. What is to become to the Three Score
3024	and Ten?"
3025	Beta stared'at me. 'He cannot die the true death,' said the bald little
3026	androgyny. 'He is of the cruciform."
3027	Somewhat later, while continuing my medscans of the tribe, I discovered
3028	the truth. The one I have tagged as Theta looks the same and acts the
3029	same, but now carries two cruciforms embedded in his flesh. I have no
3030	doubt that this is one Bikura who will tend toward corpulence in coming
3031	years, swelling and ripening like some obscene E coli cell in a petri
3032	dish. When he/she/it dies, two will leave the tomb and the Three Score
3033	and Ten will be complete once more.
3034	I believe I am going mad.
3035	Day I95:
3036	Weeks of studying the damn parasite and still no clue as to how it
3037	functions. Worse, I no longer care. What I care about now is more
3038	important.
3039	Why has GOd allowed this obscenity?
3040	Why have the Bikura been punished this way?
3041	Why was I chosen to suffer their fate?
3042	I ask these questions in nightly prayers but I hear no answers, only the
3043	blood song of the wind from the Cleft.
3044	Day 2I4:
3045	The last ten pages should have covered all of my field notes and
3046	technical conjectures. This will be my last entry before attempting the
3047	quiescent flame forest in the morning.
3048	There is no doubt that I have discovered the ultimate in stagnant human
3049	societies. The Bikura have realized the human dream of immortality and
3050	have paid for it with their humanity and their immortal souls.
3051	Edouard, I have spent-so many hours wrestling with my faith - my lack of
3052	faith - but now, in this fearful corner of an all but forgotten world,
3053	riddied as I am with this loathsome parasite, I have somehow
3054	rediscovered a strength of belief the likes of which I have not known
3055	since you and I were boys. I now understand the need for faith- pure,
3056	blind, fly-in-the-face-of-reason faith- as a small life preserver in the
3057	wild and endless sea of a universe ruled by unfeeling laws and totally
3058	indifferent to the small, reasoning beings that inhabit it.
3059	Day after day I have tried to leave the Cleft area and day after day I
3060	have suffered pain so terrible that it has become a tangible part of my
3061	world, like the too small
3062	sun or the green and lapis sky. Pain has become my ally, my guardian
3063	angel, my remaining link with humanity.
3064	The cruciform does not like pain. Nor do I but, like the cruciform, I
3065	am willing to use it to serve my purposes.
3066	And I will do so consciously, not instinctively like the mindless mass
3067	of alien tissue embedded in me. This thing only seeks a mindless
3068	avoidance of death by any means.
3069	I do not wish to die, but I welcome pain and death rather than an
3070	eternity of mindless life. Life is sacred - I still 'hold to that as a
3071	core element of the Church's thought and teachings these past
3072	twenty-eight hundred years when life has been so cheap - but even more
3073	sacred is the soul.
3074	I realize now that what I was trying to do with the Armaghast data was
3075	offer the Church not a rebirth but only a transition to a false life
3076	such as these poor walking corpses inhabit. If the Church is meant to
3077	die, it must do so - but do so gloriously, in the full knowledge of its
3078	rebirth in Christ. It must go into the darkness not willingly but well
3079	- bravely and firm of faith - like the millions who have gone before us,
3080	keeping faith with all those generations facing death in the isolated
3081	silence of death camps and nuclear fireballs and cancer wards and
3082	pogroms, going into the darkness, if not hopefully, then prayerfully
3083	that there is some reason for it all, something worth the price of all
3084	that pain, all those sacrifices.
3085	All those before us have gone into the darkness without assurance of
3086	logic or fact or persuasive theory, with only a slender thread of hope
3087	or the all too shakable conviction of faith. And if they have been able
3088	to sustain that slim hope in the face of darkness, then so must I... and
3089	so must the Church.
3090	! no longer believe that any surgery or treatment can cure me of this
3091	thing that infests me, but if someone can separate it and study it and
3092	destroy it, even at the cost of my death, l will be well satisfied.
3093	The flame forests are as quiet as they will ever be. To bed now. I
3094	leave before dawn.
3095	Day. 2I5:
3096	There is no way out.
3097	Fourteen kilometers into the forest. Stray fires and bursts of current,
3098	but penetrable. Three weeks of walking would have got me through.
3099	The cruciform will not let me go.
3100	The pain was like a heart attack that would not stop.
3101	Still I staggered forward, stumbling and crawling through the ash.
3102	Eventually I lost consciousness. When I came to I was crawling toward
3103	the Cleft. I would turn away, walk a kilometer, crawl fifty meters,
3104	then lose consciousness again and awakeback where I had started.
3105	All day this insane battle for my body went on.
3106	Before sunset the Bikura entered the forest, found me
3107	five kilometers from the Cleft, and carried me back.
3108	Dear Jesus, why have you let this be?
3109	There is no hope now unless someone comes looking for me.
3110	Day 223:
3111	Again the attempt. Again the pain. Again the failure.
3112	Day257:
3113	I am sixty-eight standard years old today. Work goes on with the chapel
3114	I am building near the Cleft.
3115	Attempted to descend to the river yesterday but was turned back by Beta
3116	and four others.
3117	Day 280:
3118	One local year on Hyperion. One year in purgatory.
3119	Or is it hell?
3120	Day3II:
3121	Working on quarrying stones on the ledges below the shelf where the
3122	chapel is going up and I made the discovery today: the arrestor rods.
3123	The Bikura must have thrown them over the edge when they murdered Tuk
3124	that night two hundred and twenty-three days ago.
3125	These rods would allow me to penetrate the flame forest at any time if
3126	the cruciform would allow it. But it will not. If only they had not
3127	destroyed my medkits with the painkillers! But still, sitting here
3128	holding the rods today, I have an idea.
3129	My crude experiments with the medscanner have continued.
3130	Two weeks ago when Theta broke his leg in three places, I observed the
3131	reaction of the cruciform. The parasite did its best to block the pain;
3132	Theta was unconscious much of the time and his body was producing
3133	incredible quantities of endorphins. But the break was a very painful
3134	one and after four days the Bikura slashed Theta's throat and took his
3135	body to the basilica. It was easier for the cruciform to resurrect his
3136	corpse than to tolerate such pain over a long period. But before his
3137	murder my scanner showed an appreciable retreat of the cruciform
3138	nematodes from some parts of the central nervous system.
3139	I do not know if it would be possible to inflict on oneself - or to
3140	tolerate - levels of nonlethal pain sufficient to drive the cruciform
3141	out completely, but I am sure of one thing: the Bikura would not allow
3142	it.
3143	Today I sit on the ledge below the half-finished chapel and I consider
3144	possibilities.
3145	Day 438:
3146	The chapel is finished. It is my !ife's work.
3147	Tonight, when the Bikura went down into the Cleft for their daily parody
3148	of worship, I said Mass at the altar of the newly erected chapel. I had
3149	baked the bread from chalma flour and I am sure that it must have tasted
3150	of that bland, yellow leaf, but to me the taste was exactly like that of
3151	the first Host I had partaken of during my first Holy Communion in
3152	Villefranche-sur-Sa/}ne some sixty standard years earlier.
3153	!n the morning I will do what I have planned. Everything is in
3154	readiness: my journals and the medscan wafers will be in the pouch of
3155	woven bestos fibers. That is the best I can do.
3156	The consecrated wine was only water, but in the dim light of sunset it
3157	looked blood red and tasted of communion wine.
3158	The trick will be to penetrate deep enough into the flame forest. I
3159	will have to trust that there is enough incipient activity in and from
3160	the tesla trees even during the quiet periods.
3161	Goodbye, Edouard. I doubt if you are still alive, and should you be, I
3162	see no way that we could be reunited, separated aswe are not only by
3163	years of distance but by a much wider gulf in the form of a cross. My
3164	hope of seeing you again shall not be placed on this life but on the one
3165	to come. Strange to hear me speak like this again, is it not? I must
3166	tell you, Edouard, that after all these decades of uncertainty, and with
3167	great fear of what lies ahead, my heart and soul are nonetheless at
3168	peace.
3169	Oh, my God,
3170	I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, And I detest all my sins,
3171	Because of the loss of heaven And the pains of hell,
3172	But most of all because I have offended Thee, My God,
3173	Who art all good
3174	And deserving of all my love."
3175	I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace to
3176	confess my sins, to do penance,
3177	And to amend my life,
3178	Amen.
3179	2400 hours:
3180	The sunset comes through the open chapel window and bathes the altar,
3181	the crudely carved chalice, and me
3182	in light. The wind from the Cleft rises in the last such chorus that -
3183	with luck and God's mercy - I will ever hear.
3184	'That is the final entry,' said Lenar Hoyt.
3185	When th priest quit reading, the six pilgrims at the table raised their
3186	faces toward him as if they were awakening from a common dream. The
3187	Consul glanced upward and saw that Hyperion was much closer now, filling
3188	a third of the sky, banishing the stars with its cold radiance.
3189	'I arrived some ten weeks after. I had last seen Father Dur6,'
3190	continued Father Hoyt. His voice was a hoarse rasp. 'More than eight
3191	years had passed on Hyperion .. seven years since the last entry in
3192	Father Dul's journal." The priest was visibly in pain now, his face
3193	paled to a sick !uminescence and filmed with perspiration.
3194	'Within a month I found my way to Perecebo Plantation upriver from Port
3195	Romance,' he continued, forcing some strength into his voice. 'My
3196	assumption was that the fiberplastic growers might tell me the truth
3197	even if they would have nothing to do with the consulate or Home Rule
3198	Authorities. I was right. The administrator at Perecebo, a man named
3199	Orlandi, remembered Father Dur, as did Orlandi's new wife, the woman
3200	named Semfa whom Father Dur6 mentioned in his journals.
3201	The plantation manager had tried to mount several rescue operations onto
3202	the Plateau, but an unprecedented series of active seasons in the flame
3203	forests had made them abandon their attempts. After several years they
3204	had given up hope that Dur or their man Tuk could still be alive.
3205	'Nonetheless, Orlandi recruited two expert bush pilots to fly a rescue
3206	expedition up the Cleft in two plantation skimmers. We stayed in the
3207	Cleft itself for as long as we could, trusting to terrain-avoidance
3208	instruments and luck to get us to Bikura country. Even with bypassing
3209	most of the flame forest that way, we lost one of the skimmers and four
3210	people to tesla activity."
3211	Father Hoyt paused and swayed slightly. Gripping the
3212	edge of the table to steady himself, he cleared his throat and said,
3213	'There's little else to tell. We located the Bikura village. There
3214	were seventy of them, each as stupid and uncommunicative as Dur's notes
3215	had suggested.
3216	I managed to ascertain from them that Father Dur6 had died while trying
3217	to penetrate the flame forest. The bestos pouch had survived and in it
3218	we found his journals and medical data." Hoyt looked at the others a
3219	second and then glanced down. 'We persuaded them to show us where
3220	Father Dur6 had died,' he said. 'They...
3221	ah... they had not buried him. His remains were badly burned and
3222	decomposed but complete enough to show us that the intensity of the
3223	tesla charges had destroyed the... the cruciform... as well as his
3224	body.
3225	'Father Dur6 had died the true death We returned the remains to the
3226	Perecebo Plantation where he was buried following a full funeral Mass."
3227	Hoyt took a deep breath. 'Over my strong objections, M. Orlandi
3228	destroyed the Bikura village and a section of the Cleft wall with shaped
3229	nuclear charges he had brought from the plantation. I do not believe
3230	that any of the Bikura could have survived. As far as we could tell,
3231	the entrance to the labyrinth and the so-called basilica also must have
3232	been destroyed in the landslide.
3233	'I had sustained se/eral injuries during the expedition and thus had to
3234	remain at the plantation for several months before returning to the
3235	northern continent and booking passage to Pacem. No one knows of these
3236	journals or their contents except M. Orlandi, Monsignor Edouard, and
3237	whichever of his superiors Monsignor Edouard chose to tell. As far as I
3238	know, the Church has issued no declaration relating to the journals of
3239	Father Paul Dur6."
3240	Father Hoyt had been standing and now he sat. Sweat dripped from his
3241	chin and his face was blue-white in the reflected light of Hyperion.
3242	'Is that... all?" asked Martin Silenus.
3243	'Yes,' managed Father Hoyt.
3244	'Gentlemen and lady,' said Het Masteen, 'it is late. I suggest that you
3245	gather your luggage and rendezvous at our friend the Consui's ship on
3246	sphere eleven in thirty
3247	minutes or sooner. I will be using one of the tree's drop-ships to join
3248	you later."
3249	Most of the group was assembled in less than fifteen minutes. The
3250	Templars had rigged a gangway from a work pier on the interior of the
3251	sphere to the ship's top-tier balcony, and the Consul led the way into
3252	the lounge as crew clones stowed luggage and departed.
3253	'A fascinating old instrument,' said Colonel Kassad as he ran one hand
3254	across the top of the Steinway.
3255	'Harpsichord?"
3256	'Piano,' said the Consul. 'Pre-Hegira. Are we all here?"
3257	'Everyone except Hoyt,' said Brawne Lamia as she.
3258	took a seat in the projection pit.
3259	Het Masteen entered. 'The Hegemony warship has granted permission for
3260	you to descend to Keats's space-port,' said the Captain. He glanced
3261	around. 'I will send a crew member to see if M. Hoyt needs
3262	assistance."
3263	'No,' said the Consul. He modulated his voice. 'I'd like to get him.
3264	Can you tell me the way to his quarters?"
3265	The treeship Captain looked at the Consul for a long second and then
3266	reached into the folds of his robe. 'Bon voyage,' he said, handing over
3267	a wafer. 'I will see you on the planet, sometime before our midnight
3268	departure time from the Shrike's Temple in Keats."
3269	The Consul bowed. 'It was a pleasure traveling within the protective
3270	branches of the Tree, Het Masteen,' he said formally. Turning to the
3271	others, he gestured.
3272	'Please make yourselves comfortable in the lounge or the library on the
3273	desk below this. The ship will see to your needs and answer any
3274	questions you might have.
3275	We will depart as soon as Father Hoyt and I return."
3276	The priest's environment pod was halfway up the treeship, far out on a
3277	secondary branch. As the Consul expected, the comlog direction wafer
3278	Het Masteen had given him also served as a palmlock override. After
3279	useless minutes tapping the announcer chime and pounding on the access
3280	portal, the Consul triggered the override and stepped into the pod.
3281	Father Hoyt was on his knees, writhing in the center of the grass
3282	carpet. Bedclothes, gear, garments, and the contents of a standard
3283	medkit were strewn on the floor around him. He had torn off his tunic
3284	and collar and sweated through his shirt so that it now hung in damp
3285	folds, ripped and tattered where he had clawed through the fabric.
3286	Hyperion light seeped through the pod wall, making the bizarre tableau
3287	appear to be staged underwater - or, thought the Consul, in a cathedral.
3288	Lenar Hoyt's face contorted in agony as his hands raked at his chest.
3289	Muscles on his exposed forearms writhed like living creatures moving
3290	beneath his pale tarp of a skin. 'The injector... malfunctioned,'
3291	gasped Hoyt. 'Please."
3292	The Consul nodded, commanded the door to close, and knelt next to the
3293	priest. He removed the useless injector from Hoyt's clenched fist and
3294	ejected the syrette ampule. Ultramorphine. The Consul nodded again and
3295	took out an injector from the medkit he had brought from his ship. It
3296	took less than five seconds to load the ultramorph.
3297	'Please,' begged Hoyt. His whole body spasmed. The Consul could almost
3298	see the waves of pain passing through the man.
3299	'Yes,' said the Consul. He took a ragged breath. 'But first the rest
3300	of the story."
3301	Hoyt stared, reached weakly for the injector.
3302	Sweating himself now, the Consul held the instrument just out of reach.
3303	'Yes, in a second,' he said. 'After the rest of the story. It's
3304	important that I know."
3305	'Oh, God, sweet Christ,' sobbed Hoyt. 'Please!'
3306	'Yes,' gasped the Consul. 'Yes. As soon as you tell me the truth."
3307	Father Hoyt collapsed onto his forearms, breathing in quick pants. 'You
3308	fucking bastard,' he gasped. The priest took several deep breaths, held
3309	one until his body quit shaking, and tried to sit up. When he looked at
3310	the Consul, there was something like relief in the maddened
3311	eyes. 'Then... you'll give me... the shot?"
3312	'Yes,' said the Consul.
3313	'All right,' Hoyt managed in a sour whisper. 'The
3314	truth. Perecebo Plantation... like I said. We flew in ... early
3315	October ... Lycius ... eight years after Dur6 ... disappeared. Oh,
3316	Christ, it hurts! Alcohol and endos don't work at all anymore. Only...
3317	pure ultramorph..."
3318	'Yes,' whispered the Consul. 'It's ready. As soon as the story is
3319	done."
3320	The priest lowered his head. Sweat dripped from his cheeks and nose
3321	onto the short grass. The Consul saw the man's muscles tense as if he
3322	were going to attack, then another spasm of pain wracked the thin body
3323	and Hoyt sagged forward. 'Skimmer wasn't destroyed...
3324	by tesla. Semfa, two men, and I... forced down near the Cleft while...
3325	while Orlandi searched upriver. His skimmer... had to wait while the
3326	lightning storm died down.
3327	'Bikura came in the night. Killed... killed Semfa, the pilot, the
3328	other man... forget his name. Left me ·.. alive." Hoyt reached for
3329	his crucifix, realized that he had torn it off. He laughed briefly,
3330	stopping before the laughter turned to sobs. 'They... told me about
3331	the way of the cross. About the cruciform. Told me about ·.. the Son
3332	of the Flames.
3333	'Next morning, they took me to see the Son. Took me ·.. to see him."
3334	Hoyt struggled upright and clawed at his own cheeks. His eyes were
3335	wide, the ultramorph obviously forgotten despite the pain. 'About three
3336	kilometers into the flame forest... big tesla... eighty, a hundred
3337	meters tall, at least. Quiet then, but still a lot ... a lot of charge
3338	in the air. Ash everywhere.
3339	'The Bikura wouldn't... wouldn't go too close. Just knelt there with
3340	their goddamned bald heads bowed. But I... went close... had to. Dear
3341	God... Oh, Christ, it was him. Dur6. What was left of him.
3342	'He'd used a ladder to get three ... maybe four meters... up on the
3343	bole of the tree. Built a sort of platform. For his feet. Broken the
3344	arrestor rods off...
3345	little more than spikes ... then sharpened them· Must've used a rock to
3346	drive the long one through his feet into the bestos platform and tree.
3347	'His left arm... he'd pounded the stake between the
3348	radius and ulna ... missed veins ... just like the goddamned Romans.
3349	Very secure as long as his skeleton was intact. Other hand... right
3350	hand... palm down.
3351	He'd driven the spike first. Sharpened both ends. Then · . . impaled
3352	his right hand. Somehow bent the spike over. Hook.
3353	'Ladder'd fallen... long ago... but it was bestos.
3354	Hadn't burned. Used it to climb up to him. Everything'd burned away
3355	years ago... clothes, skin, top layers of flesh... but the bestos
3356	pouch was still around his neck.
3357	'The alloy spikes still conducted current even when ·.. I could see
3358	it... feel it... surging through what was left of the body.
3359	'It still looked like Paul Dur. Important. I told Monsignor. No skin.
3360	Flesh raw or boiled away. Nerves and things visible... like gray and
3361	yellow roots. Christ, the smell. But it still looked like Paul Dur!
3362	'i understood then. Understood it all. Somehow...
3363	even before reading the journals. Understood he'd been hanging there...
3364	oh, dear God... seven years Living.
3365	Dying· The cruciform . . . forcing him to live again.
3366	Electricity ... surging through him every second of those ... those
3367	Seven years. Flames. Hunger. Pain.
3368	Death. But somehow the goddamned... cruciform...
3369	!eeching substance from the tree maybe, the air, what was left...
3370	rebuilding what it could... forcing him to live, to feel the pain, over
3371	and over and over...
3372	' 'But he won. Pain was his ally. Oh, Jesus, not a few hours on the
3373	tree and then the spear and rest, but seven years!
3374	'But . . . he won. When I removed the pouch, the cruciform on his
3375	chest fell away also. Just... fell right off... long, bloody roots.
3376	Then the thing... the thing I'd been sure was a corpse .".. the man
3377	raised its head.
3378	No eyelids. Eyes baked white. Lips gone. But it looked at me and
3379	smiled. He smiled. And he died . . . really died... there in my
3380	arms. The ten thousandth time, but real this time. He smiled at me and
3381	died."
3382	Hoyt stopped, communed in silence with his own pain, and then continued
3383	between bouts of clenching his teeth. 'Bikura took me... back to...
3384	Cleft Orlandi
3385	came the next day. Rescued me. He... Semfa... I couldn't... he
3386	iasered the village, burned the Bikura where they stood like stupid
3387	sheep. I didn't... didn't argue with him. I laughed· Dear God,
3388	forgive me.
3389	Orlandi nuked the site with shaped charges they used to ·.. to clear
3390	the jungle·.. fiberplastic matrix."
3391	Hoyt looked directly at the Consul and made a contorted gesture with his
3392	right hand. 'The painkillers worked all right at first. But every
3393	year... every day ... got worse. Even in fugue... the pain. I would
3394	have had to come back anyway. How could he . . . seven years! Oh,
3395	Jesus,' said Father Hoyt and clawed at the carpet.
3396	The Consul moved quickly, injecting the full ampule of ultramorph just
3397	under the armpit, catching the priest as he collapsed, and gently
3398	lowering the unconscious form to the floor. His vision unclear, the
3399	Consul ripped open Hoyt's sweat-sodden shirt, casting the rags aside.
3400	It was there, of course, lying under the pale skin of Hoyt's chest like
3401	some great, raw, cross-shaped worm.
3402	The Consul took a breath and gently turned the priest over. The second
3403	cruciform was where he had expected to find it, a slightly smaller,
3404	cross-shaped welt between the thin man's shoulder blades. It stirred
3405	slightly as the Consul's fingers brushed the fevered flesh.
3406	The Consul moved slowly but efficiently- packing the priest's
3407	belongings, straightening the room, dressing the unconscious man with
3408	the gentle care one would use in clothing the body of a dead family
3409	member.
3410	The Consui's.comiog buzzed. 'We need to go,' came Colonel Kassad's
3411	voice.
3412	'We're coming,' replied the Consul. He coded the comlog to summon crew
3413	clones to fetch the luggage, but lifted Father Hoyt himself. The body
3414	seemed to weigh nothing.
3415	The door dilated open and the Consul stepped out, moving from the deep
3416	shadow of the branch into the blue-green glow of the world which filled
3417	the sky.
3418	Deciding what cover story he would tell the others, the Consul paused a
3419	second to look at the sleeping man's face. He glanced up at Hyperion
3420	and then moved on.
3421	Even if the gravity field had been full Earth standard, the Consul knew,
3422	the body in his arms would have been no burden.
3423	Once a parent to a child now dead, the Consul walked on, knowing once
3424	again the sensation of bearing a sleeping son to bed.
3425	TWO
3426	It had been a warm, rainy day in Keats, Hyperion's capi-tai, and even
3427	after the rains stopped a layer of clouds moved slow and heavy over the
3428	city, filling the air with the salt scent of the ocean twenty kilometers
3429	to the west.
3430	Toward evening, as the gray daylight was beginning to fade into gray
3431	twilight, a double sonic boom shook the town and then echoed from the
3432	single, sculpted peak to the south. The clouds glowed blue-white. Half
3433	a minute later an ebony spacecraft broke through the overcast and
3434	descended carefully on a tail of fusion flame, its navigation lights
3435	blinking red and green against the gray.
3436	At one thousand meters the craft's landing beacons flared and three
3437	beams of coherent light from the space-port north of town locked the
3438	ship in a welcoming ruby tripod. The spacecraft hovered at three
3439	hundred meters, slipped sideways as smoothly as a mug sliding on a wet
3440	table top, and then settled weightlessly into a waiting blast pit.
3441	High-iressure jets of water bathed the pit and the base of the ship,
3442	sending up billows of steam to blend with the curtain of drizzle blowing
3443	across the paved plain of the spaceport. When the water jets ceased
3444	there was no noise except the whisper of rain and the random ticks and
3445	creaks of the cooling spaceshi.
3446	A balcony extruded itself from the ship's 'bulkhead twenty meters above
3447	the pit wail. Five figures emerged.
3448	'Thank you for the ride, sir,' Colonel Kassad said to the Consul.
3449	The Consul nodded and leaned on the railing, taking in deep breaths of
3450	fresh air. Droplets of rain beaded on his shoulders and eyebrows.
3451	Sol Weintraub lifted his baby from her infant carrier.
3452	Some change in pressure, temperature, scent, motion, noise, or a
3453	combination of all of these had awakened her and now she began to cry
3454	lustily. Weintraub bounced her and cooed to her but the wailing
3455	continued.
3456	'An appropriate comment upon our arrival,' said Martin Silenus. The
3457	poet wore a long purple cape and a red beret which slouched to his right
3458	shoulder. He took a drink from a wineglass he had carried out from the
3459	lounge. 'Christ on a stick, this place looks different."
3460	The Consul, who had been away only eight local years, had to agree. The
3461	spaceport had been a full nine klicks from the city when he lived in
3462	Keats; now shacks, tents, and mud streets surrounded the landing field's
3463	perimeter.
3464	In the Consui's day, no more than a ship a week had put in at the tiny
3465	spaceport; now he counted more than twenty spacecraft on the field. The
3466	small administration and customs building had been superseded by a huge,
3467	prefabricated structure, a dozen new blast pits and drop-ship grids had
3468	been added where the field had been hastily extended to the west, and
3469	the perimeter now was littered with scores of camouflage-sheathed
3470	modules which the Consul knew must serve as everything from ground
3471	control stations to barracks. A forest of exotic antennae grew skyward
3472	from a cluster of such boxes at the far end of the landing apron.
3473	'Progress,' murmured the Consul.
3474	'War,' said Colonel Kassad.
3475	'Those are people,' said Brawne Lamia, pointing toward the main terminal
3476	gates on the south side of the field. A wave of drab colors crashed
3477	like a silent surf
3478	against the outer fence and the violet containment field.
3479	'My God,' said the Consul, 'you're right."
3480	Kassad produced his binoculars and they took turns staring at the
3481	thousands of forms tugging at the wire, pressing against the repelling
3482	field.
3483	'Why are they here?" asked Lamia. 'What do they want?" Even from half a
3484	kilometer away, the mindless will of the mob was daunting. Dark forms
3485	of FORCE: Marines could be seen patrolling just within the perimeter.
3486	The Consul realized that between the wire, the containment field, and
3487	the Marines a strip of raw earth
3488	almost surely signified mines or a deathbeam zone, or both.
3489	'What do they want?" repeated Lamia.
3490	'They want out,' said Kassad.
3491	Even before the Colonel spoke, the Consul realized that the shack city
3492	around the spaceport and the mob at the gates were inevitable; the
3493	people of Hyperion were ready to leave. He guessed that there must be
3494	such a silent surge toward the gates each time a ship landed.
3495	'Well, there's one who'll be staying,' said Martin Silenus and pointed
3496	toward the low mountain across the river to the south. 'Old Weeping
3497	William Rex, God rest his sinful soul." The sculpted face of Sad King
3498	Billy was just visible through the light rain and growing darkness.
3499	'l knew him. Horatio,' said the drunken poet. 'A man of infinite jest.
3500	Not one of them funny. A real horse's ass, Horatio."
3501	Sol Weintraub stood just inside the ship, shielding his baby from the
3502	drizzle and removing her cries from the vicinity of the conversation. He
3503	pointed. 'Someone is coming."
3504	A groundcar with its camouflage polymer inert and a military EMV
3505	modified with hoverfans for Hyperion's weak magnetic field were crossing
3506	the damp hardpan.
3507	Martin Silenus's gaze never left Sad King Billy's dour visage. Silenus
3508	said in a voice almost too soft to be heard:
3509	'Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
3510	Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon, and
3511	eve's one star, Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,
3512	Still as the silence round about his lair; Forest on forest hung above
3513	his head
3514	Like cloud on cloud..."
3515	Father Hoyt came onto the balcony, rubbing his face with both hands. His
3516	eyes were wide and unfocused, a child rising from his nap. 'Are we
3517	there?" he asked.
3518	'Fucking aye,' cried Martin Silenus, returning the binoculars to the
3519	Colonel. 'Let's go down and greet'the gendarmes."
3520	The young Marine lieutenant seemed unimpressed with the group even after
3521	he had scanned the authorization wafer Her Masteen had passed along from
3522	the task force commander. The lieutenant took his time scanning their
3523	visa chips, letting them wait in the drizzle, occasionally making a
3524	comment with the idle arrogance common to such nobodies who have just
3525	come into a small bit of power. Then he came to Fedmahn Kassad's chip
3526	and looked up with the expression of a startled stoat. 'Colonel
3527	Kassad!'
3528	'Retired,' said Kassad.
3529	'l'm sorry, sir,' said the lieutenant, stumbling over his words as he
3530	fumbled the visas back to everyone. 'I had no idea you were with this
3531	party, sir. That is ... the Captain just said... I mean... my uncle
3532	was with you on Bressia, sir. I mean, I'm sorry... anything I or my
3533	men can do to..."
3534	'At ease, Lieutenant,' said Kassad. 'Is there any chance of getting
3535	some transport into the city?"
3536	'Ah... well, sir..." The young Marine started to rub his chin and then
3537	remembered that he was wearing his helmet. 'Yes, sir. But the problem
3538	is, sir, the mobs can get pretty nasty and... well, the damn EMVs don't
3539	work for shit on this. '. uh, pardon me, sir. You see, the ground
3540	transports're limited to cargo and we don't have any skimmers free to
3541	leave the base until 2200 hours but I'!I be happy to get your party on
3542	the roster for..."
3543	'Just a minute,' said the Consul. A battered passenger skimmer with the
3544	gold geodesic of the Hegemony painted on one flare skirt had landed ten
3545	meters away. A tall, thin man stepped out. 'Theo!" cried the Consul.
3546	The two men stepped forward, started to shake hands, and then hugged
3547	each other instead. 'Damn,' said the Consul, 'you look good, Theo."
3548	ItWas true. His former aide had gained half a dozen years on the
3549	Consul, but the younger man still had the boyish smile, thin face, and
3550	thick red hair that had attracted every unmarried woman - annot a few
3551	married ones - on the consulate staff. The shyness which had been part
3552	of Theo Lane's vulnerability was still there, as evidenced by the way he
3553	now needlessly adjusted his archaic horn-rimmed glasses - the young
3554	diplomat's one affectation.
3555	'It's good to have you back,' said Theo.
3556	The Consul turned, started to introduce his friend to the group, and
3557	then stopped. 'My God,' he said, 'you're Consul now. I'm sorry, Theo,
3558	I wasn't thinking."
3559	Theo Lane smiled and adjusted his glasses. 'No problem, sir,' he said.
3560	'Actually, l'm no longer Consul. For the last few months I've been
3561	acting Governor-General.
3562	The Home Rule council finally requested - and received - formal colonial
3563	status. Welcome to the newest world in the Hegemony."
3564	The Consul stared a second and then hugged his former protg again.
3565	'Congratulations, Your Excellency."
3566	Theo grinned and glanced at the sky. 'It's going to rain in earnest
3567	before long. Why don't we get your group aboard the skimmer and VII
3568	drive you into town." The new Governor-General smiled at the young
3569	Marine.
3570	'Lieutenant?"
3571	'Uh ... yes, sir?" The officer had snapped to attention.
3572	'Could you get your men to load these good people's luggage, please?
3573	We'd all like to get in out of the rain."
3574	The skimmer flew south above the highway at a steady sixty meters. The
3575	Consul rode in the front passenger seat; the rest of the group relaxed
3576	in flowfoam recliners behind. Martin Silenus and Father Hoyt appeared
3577	to be asleep. Weintraub's baby had ceased crying in favor of nursing on
3578	a soft bottle of synthesized mother's milk.
3579	'Things have changed,' said the Consul. He rested his cheek against the
3580	rain-spattered canopy and looked down at the chaos.
3581	Thousand of shacks and iean-tos covered the hillsides and gullies along
3582	the three-klick ride to the suburbs.
3583	Fires were being lighted under wet tarps and the Consul watched
3584	mud-colored figures moving between mud-colored shacks. High fences had
3585	been rigged along the old Spaceport Highway and the road itself had been
3586	widened and regraded. Two lanes of truck and hover traffic,
3587	ill
3588	most of it military green or shrouded with inactive camouflage polymer,
3589	moved sluggishly in both directions.
3590	Ahead, the lights of Keats seemed to have multiplied and spread across
3591	new sections of the river valley and hills.
3592	'Three million,' said Tbeo, as if reading his former boss's mind. 'At
3593	least three million people and growing every day."
3594	The Consul stared. 'There were only four and a half million people on
3595	the planet when I left."
3596	'Still are,' said the new Governor-General. 'And every one of them
3597	wants to get to Keats, board a ship, and get the hell out. Some are
3598	waiting for the farcaster to be built, but most don't believe it'll
3599	happen in time. They're afraid."
3600	'Of the Ousters?"
3601	'Them too,' said Theo, 'but mosfiy of the Shrike."
3602	The Consul turned his face from the coolness of the canopy. 'It's come
3603	south of the Bridle Range then?"
3604	Theo laughed without humor. 'It's everywhere. Or they're everywhere.
3605	Most people are convinced that there are dozens or hundreds of the
3606	things now. Shrike deaths have been reported on all three continents.
3607	Everywhere except Keats, segments of the coast along the Mane, and a few
3608	of the big cities like Endymion."
3609	'How many casualties?" The Consul did not really want to know.
3610	'At least twenty thousand dead or missing,' said Theo.
3611	'There are a lot of injured people but that isn't the Shrike, is it?"
3612	Again came the dry laugh. 'The Shrike doesn't just wound people, does
3613	it? Uh-uh, people shoot each other by accident, fall down stairways or
3614	jump out windows in their panic, and trample each other in crowds. It's
3615	a fucking mess."
3616	In the eleven years the Consul had worked with Theo Lane, he had never
3617	heard the younger man use profanity of .any sort. 'Is FORCE any help?"
3618	the Consul asked.
3619	'Ai'e they what's keeping the Shrike away from the big cities?"
3620	Theo shook his head. 'FORCE hasn't done a damn thing except control the
3621	mobs. Oh, the Marines put on a
3622	show of keeping the spaceport open here and the harbor landing zone at
3623	Port R secure, but they haven't even tried to confront the Shrike.
3624	They're waiting to fight the Ousters."
3625	,'SDF?" asked the Consul, knowing even as he spoke that the poorly
3626	trained Self-defense Force would have been of little use.
3627	Theo snorted. 'At least eight thousand of the casualties are SDF.
3628	General Braxton took the "Fighting Third" up the River Road to "strike
3629	at the Shrike menace in their lair" and that was the last we heard of
3630	them."
3631	'You're joking,' said the Consul, but one look at his friend's face told
3632	him that he wasn't. 'Theo,' he said, 'how in the world did you have
3633	time to meet us at the spaceport?"
3634	'I didn't,' said the Governor-General. He glanced in the back. The
3635	others were sleeping or staring exhaustedly out windows. 'I needed to
3636	talk to you,' said Theo. 'Convince you not to go."
3637	The Consul started to shake his head but Theo grasped his arm, squeezed
3638	hard. 'Now listen to what I have to say, damn it. I know how hard it
3639	is for you to come back here after... what happened but, goddamn it,
3640	there's no sense in your throwing everything away for no reason.
3641	Abandon this stupid pilgrimage. Stay in Keats."
3642	'I can't..." began the Consul.
3643	'Listen to me,' demanded Theo. 'Reason one: you're the finest diplomat
3644	and crisis manager I've ever seen and
3645	we need your skills."
3646	'It doesn't..."
3647	'Shut up a minute. Reason two: you and the others won't get within two
3648	hundred klicks of the Time Tombs.
3649	Thais isn't like the old days when you were here and the goddamned
3650	suicides could get up there and even sit around for a week and maybeeven
3651	change their minds and
3652	come home. The Shrike is on the move. It's like a plague." 'I
3653	understand that but..."
3654	'Reason three: lneed you. I begged Tau Ceti Center to' send someone
3655	else out. When I found that you were coming...
3656	well, hell, it got me through the last two years."
3657	The Consul shook his head, not understanding.
3658	Theo started the turn toward the city center and then hovered, taking
3659	his eyes off the controls to look directly at the Consul. '! want you
3660	to take over the governor-generalship.
3661	The Senate won't interfere- except perhaps for Gladstone o and by the
3662	time she finds out, it will be too late."
3663	The Consul felt as though someone had struck him below the third rib. He
3664	looked away, down at the maze of narrow streets and crooked buildings
3665	that was Jacktown, the Old City. When he could speak again, he said, 'I
3666	can't, Theo."
3667	'Listen, if you..."
3668	'No. I mean I cannot. It would be no good if I did accept it, but the
3669	simple truth is, I can't. I have to go on this pilgrimage."
3670	Theo straightened his glasses, stared straight ahead.
3671	'Look, Theo, you're the most competent and capable Foreign Service
3672	professional l've ever worked with. I've been out of things for eight
3673	years. I think..."
3674	Theo nodded tersely, interrupted. 'I suppose you want
3675	to go to the Shrike Temple." ·
3676	,yes."
3677	The skimmer circled and settled. The Consul was staring at
3678	nothing,.thinking, when the side doors of the skimmer raised and folded
3679	and Sol Weintraub said, 'Good God."
3680	The group stepped out and stared at the charred and toppled wreckage of
3681	what had been the Shrike Temple.
3682	Since the Time Tombs had been closed as too dangerous some twenty-five
3683	local years earlier, the Shrike Temple had become Hyperion's most
3684	popular tourist attraction.
3685	Filling three full city blocks, rising more than a hundred and fifty
3686	meters to its central, sharpened spire, the Shrike Church's central
3687	temple was part awe-inspiring cathedral, part Gothic joke with its
3688	fluid, buttressed curves of stone permabonded to its whiskered-alloy
3689	skeleton, part Escher print with its tricks of perspective and
3690	impossible angles, part Boschian nightmare with its tunnel entrances,
3691	hidden chambers, dark gardens, and forbidden sections, and - more than
3692	anything else - it had been part of Hyperion's past.
3693	Now it was gone. Tall heaps of blackened stone were the only hint of
3694	the structure's former majesty. Melted alloy girders rose from the
3695	stones like the ribs of some giant carcass. Much of the rubble had
3696	tumbled into the pits, basements, and passages which had lain beneath
3697	the three-century-old landmark. The Consul walked close to the edge of
3698	a pit and wondered if the deep basements had - as legend decreed -
3699	actually connected to one of the planet's labyrinths.
3700	'It looks as if they used a hellwhip on this place,' said Martin
3701	Silenus, using an archaic term for any high-energy laser weapon. The
3702	poet seemed suddenly sobered as he joined the Consul at the edge of the
3703	pit. 'I remember when the Temple and parts of the Old City were the
3704	only things here,' he said. 'After the disaster near the Tombs, Billy
3705	decided to relocate Jacktown here because
3706	of the Temple. Now it's gone. Christ."
3707	'No,' said Kassad.
3708	The others looked at him.
3709	The Colonel rose from where he had been examining the rubble. 'Not a
3710	hellwhip,' he said. 'Shaped plasma charges. Several of them."
3711	'Now do you want to stay here and go on this useless pilgrimage?" asked
3712	Theo. 'Come with me back to the consulate." He was speaking to the
3713	Consul but extending the invitation to everyone.
3714	The Consul turned away from the pit, looking at his former aide but now
3715	seeing, for the first time, the Governor-General of a besieged Hegemony
3716	world. 'We can't, Your Excellency,' said the Consul. 'At least I
3717	can't. I won't speak for the others."
3718	The four men and the woman shook their heads.
3719	Silenus and Kassad began unloading luggage. The rain returned as a
3720	light mist falling out of the darkness. At that second the Consul
3721	noticed the two FORCE attack skimmers hovering above the nearby
3722	roofiops. Darkness and chameleon-polymer hulls had hidden them we!!,
3723	but the rain now revealed their outlines. Of course, thought
3724	the Consul, the Governor-General does not travel unescorted.
3725	'Did the priests escape? Were there survivors when the
3726	Temple was destroyed?" asked Brawne Lamia.
3727	'Yes,' said Theo. The de facto dictator of five million doomed souls
3728	removed his glasses and dried them on his shirttail. 'All of the Shrike
3729	Cult priests and acolytes escaped through tunnels. The mob had been
3730	surrounding this place for months. Their leader, a woman named Cammon
3731	from somewhere east of the Sea of Grass, gave everyone in the Temple
3732	plenty of warning before they set off. the DL-20."
3733	'Where were the police?" asked the Consul. 'The SDF?
3734	FORCE?"
3735	Theo Lane smiled and at that second he looked decades older than the
3736	young man the Consul had known.
3737	'You folks have been in transit for three years,' he said.
3738	'The universe has changed. Shrike cultists are being burned out and
3739	beaten up in the Web. You can imagine the attitude here. The Keats
3740	police have been absorbed under the martial law I declared fourteen
3741	months ago.
3742	They and the SDF watched while the mob torched the Temple. So did I.
3743	There were half a million people here that night."
3744	Sol Weintraub stepped closer. 'Do they know about us? About this final
3745	pilgrimage?"
3746	'If they did,' said Theo, 'none of you would be alive.
3747	You'd think they'd welcome anything that might appease the Shrike, but
3748	the only thing the mob would notice is that you were chosen by the
3749	Shrike Church. As it was, I had to overrule my own Advisory Council.
3750	They were in favor of destroying your ship before it reached the
3751	atmosphere."
3752	'Why did you?" asked the Consul. 'Overrule them, I mean. '
3753	Theo sighed and adjusted his glasses. 'Hyperion still needs the
3754	Hegemony, and Gladstone still has the vote of confidence of the All
3755	Thing, if not the Senate. And I still need you."
3756	The Consul looked at the rubble of the Shrike Temple.
3757	'This pilgrimage was over before you got here,' said Governor-General
3758	Theo Lane. 'Will you come back to the consulate with me ... at least
3759	in an advisory capacity?"
3760	'I'm sorry,' said the Consul. 'I can't."
3761	Theo turned without a word, dropped into the skimmer, and lifted off.
3762	His military escort followed as a blur in the rain.
3763	It was raining harder now. The group moved closer together in the
3764	growing darkness. Weintraub had rigged a makeshift hood over Rachel and
3765	the noise of the rain on plastic made the baby cry.
3766	'What now?" said the Consul, looking around at the night and narrow
3767	streets. Their luggage lay heaped in a soggy pile. The world smelled
3768	of ashes.
3769	Martin Silenus grinned. 'I know a bar."
3770	It turned out that the Consul also knew the bar; he had all but lived in
3771	Cicero's for most of his eleven-year assignment on Hyperion.
3772	Unlike most things in Keats, on Hyperion, Cicero's was not named after
3773	some piece of pre-Hegira literary trivia. Rumor had it that the bar was
3774	named after a section of an Old Earth city - some said Chicago, USA,
3775	others were sure it was Calcutta, AIS - but only Stan Leweski, owner and
3776	great-grandson of the founder, knew for sure, and Stan had never
3777	revealed its secret.
3778	The bar itself had overflowed over the century and a half of its
3779	existence from a walkup loft in one of Jacktown's sagging older
3780	buildings along the Hoolie River to nine levels in four sagging old
3781	buildings along the Hoolie. The only consistent elements of decor at
3782	Cicero's over the decades were the low ceilings, thick smoke, and
3783	constant background babble which offered a sense of privacy in the midst
3784	of bustle.
3785	There was no privacy this night. The Consul and the others paused as
3786	they carried their gear through the Marsh Lane entrance.
3787	'Jesus Wept,' muttered Martin Silenus
3788	Cicero's looked as if it had been invaded by barbarian hordes. Every
3789	chair was filled, every table occupied, mostly by men, and the floors
3790	were littered with packs, weapons, bedrolls, antiquated comm equipment,
3791	ration boxes, and all of the other detritus of an army of refugees...
3792	or perhaps a refugee army. The heavy air of
3793	Cicero's, which once had been filled with the blended scent of broiling
3794	steaks, wine, stim, ale, and T-free tobacco, was now laden with the
3795	overlapping smells of unwashed bodies, urine, and hopelessness.
3796	At that moment the huge form of Stan Leweski materialized out of the
3797	gloom. The bar owner's forearms were as huge and heavy as ever, but his
3798	forehead had advanced more than a few centimeters against the receding
3799	tangle of black hair and there were more creases than the Consul
3800	remembered around the dark eyes.
3801	Those eyes were wide now as Leweski stared at the Consul. 'Ghost,' he
3802	said.
3803	"No."
3804	'You are not dead?"
3805	'No."
3806	'By damn!" declared Stan Leweski and, grasping the Consul by the upper
3807	arms, picked him up as easily as a man would lift a five-year-old. 'By
3808	damn! You are not dead. What are you doing here?"
3809	'Checking your liquor license,' said the Consul. 'Put me down."
3810	Leweski carefully set the Consul down, tapped his shoulders, and
3811	grinned. He looked at Martilt Silenus and the grin changed to a frown.
3812	'You look familiar but I have never seen you before."
3813	'I knew your great*grandfather,' said Silenus. 'Which reminds me, do
3814	you have any of that pre-Hegira ale left?
3815	The warm, 'British stuff that tastes like recycled moose piss. I could
3816	never get enough of that."
3817	'Nothing left,' said Leweski. He pointed at the poet.
3818	'By damn. Grandfather Jiri's trunk. That old holo of the satyr in the
3819	original Jacktown. Can it be?" He stared at Silenus and then at the
3820	Consul, touching them both gingerly with a massive forefinger. 'Two
3821	ghosts."
3822	'Six tired people,' said the Consul. The baby began crying again.
3823	'Seven. Do you have space for us?"
3824	Leweski turned in a half circle, hands spread, palms up. 'it is all
3825	like this. No space left. No food. No wine." He squinted at Martin
3826	Silenus. 'No ale. Now we have become a big hotel with no beds. The
3827	SDF bastards stay here without paying and drink their own upcountry
3828	rotgut and wait for the world to end. That will happen soon enough, I
3829	think."
3830	The group was standing in what had once been the entrance mezzanine.
3831	Their heaped luggage joined a riot of gear already littering the floor.
3832	Small clusters of men shouldered their way through the throng and cast
3833	appraising glances at the newcomers- especially at Brawne Lamia. She
3834	returned their stares with a flat, cold glare.
3835	Stan Leweski looked at the Consul for a moment. 'I have a balcony
3836	table. Five of those SDF Death Commandos have been parked there for a
3837	week, telling everyone and each other how they are going to wipe out the
3838	Ouster Legions with their bare hands. You want the'table, I will
3839	throw the teat-suckers out."
3840	'Yes,' said the Consul.
3841	Leweski had turned to leave when Lamia stopped him with a hand on his
3842	arm. 'Would you like a little help?" she asked.
3843	Stan Leweski shrugged, grinned. 'I do not need it, but I might like it.
3844	Come."
3845	They disappeared into the crowd.
3846	The third-floor balcony had just enough room for the splintered table
3847	and six chairs. Despite the insane crowding on the main floors, stairs,
3848	and landings, no one had challenged them for the space after Leweski and
3849	Lamia threw the protesting Death Commandos over the railing and into the
3850	river nine meters below. Somehow Leweski had managed to send up a
3851	tankard of beer and a basket of bread and cold beef.
3852	The group ate in silence, obviously suffering more than the usual amount
3853	of post fugue hunger, fatigue, and depression. The darkness of the
3854	balcony was relieved only by dim, reflected light from deeper within
3855	Cicero's and by the lanterns on passing river barges. Most of the
3856	buildings along the Hoolie were dark but other city lights reflected
3857	from low clouds. The Consul could make out the ruins of the Shrike
3858	Temple half a kilometer upriver.
3859	'Well,' said Father Hoyt, obviously recovered from the heavy dose of
3860	ultramorph and teetering on the
3861	delicate balance between pain and sedation, 'what do we do next?"
3862	When no one answered, the Consul closed his eyes. He refused to take
3863	the lead in anything. Sitting on the balcony at Cicero's, it was all
3864	too easy to fall back into the rhythms of a former life; he would drink
3865	until the early morning hours, watch the predawn meteor showers as the
3866	clouds cleared, and then stagger to his empty apartment near the market,
3867	going into the consulate four hours later showered, shaved, and
3868	seemingly human except for the blood in his eyes and the insane ache in
3869	his skull. Trusting in Theo - quiet, efficient Theo - to get him
3870	through the morning. Trusting in luck to get him through the day.
3871	Trusting in the drinking at Cicero's to get him through the night.
3872	Trusting in the unimportance of his posting to get him through life.
3873	'You are all ready to leave for the pilgrimage?"
3874	The Consul's eyes snapped open. A hooded figure stood in the doorway
3875	and for a second the Consul thought it was Het Masteen, but then he
3876	realized that this man was much shorter, his voice not accented with the
3877	stilted Templar consonants.
3878	'If you are ready, we must go,' said the dark figure.
3879	'Who are you?" asked Brawne Lamia.
3880	'Come quickly,' was the shadow's only reply.
3881	Fedmahn Kassad stood, bending to keep his head from striking the
3882	ceiling, and detained the robed figure, flipping back the man's hood
3883	with a flick of his left hand.
3884	'An android!" said Lenar Hoyt, staring at the man's blue skin and
3885	blue-on-blue eyes.
3886	The Consul was less surprised. For more than a century it had been
3887	illegal to own androids in the Hegemony, and none had been biofactured
3888	for almost that long, but they were still used for manual labor in
3889	remote parts of backwater, noncolony worlds - worlds like Hyperion. The
3890	Shrike Temple had used androids extensively, complying with the Church
3891	of the Shrike doctrine which proclaimed that androids were free from
3892	original sin, therefore spiritually superior to humankind and-
3893	incidentally-exempt from the Shrike's terrible and inevitable
3894	retribution.
3895	'You must come quickly,' whispered the android, setting his hood in
3896	place.
3897	'Are you from the Temple?" asked Lamia.
3898	'Quiet!" snapped the android. He glanced into the hall, turned back,
3899	and nodded. 'We must hurry. Please follow me."
3900	All of them stood and then hesitated. The Consul watched as Kassad
3901	casually unsealed the long leather jacket he was wearing. He caught the
3902	briefest glimpse of a deathwand tucked in the Colonei's belt. Normally
3903	the Consul would have been appalled by even the thought of a deathwand
3904	nearby- the slighttest mistaken touch could pure every synapse on the
3905	balcony - but at this
3906	moment he was oddly reassured by the sight of it.
3907	'Our luggage..." began Weintraub.
3908	'It has been seen to,' whispered the hooded man.
3909	'Quickly now."
3910	The group followed the android down the stairs and into the night, their
3911	movement as tired and passive as a sigh.
3912	The Consul slept late. Half an hour after sunrise a rectangle of light
3913	found its way between the porthole's shutters and fell across his
3914	pillow. The Consul rolled away and did not wake. An hour after that
3915	there came a loud clatter as the tired mantas which had pulled the barge
3916	all night were released and fresh ones harnessed. The Consul slept on.
3917	In the next hour the footsteps and cries of the crew on the deck outside
3918	his stateroom grew louder and more persistent, but it was the warning
3919	klaxon below the locks at Karla which finally brought him up out of his
3920	sleep.
3921	Moving slowly in the druglike languor of fugue hangover, the Consul
3922	bathed as best he could with only basin and pump, dressed in loose
3923	cotton trousers, an old canvas shirt, and foam-soled walking shoes, and
3924	found his way to the mid-deck.
3925	Breakfast had been set out on a long sideboard near a weathered table
3926	which could be retracted into the deck planking. An awning shaded the
3927	eating area and the crimson and gold canvas snapped to the breeze of
3928	their
3929	passage. It was a beautiful day, cloudless and bright, with Hyperion's
3930	sun making up in ferocity what it lacked in size.
3931	M. Weintraub, Lamia, Kassad, and Silenus had been up for some time.
3932	Lenar Hoyt and Het Masteen joined the group a few minutes after the
3933	Consul arrived.
3934	The Consul helped himself to toasted fish, fruit, and orange juice at
3935	the buffet and then moved to the railing.
3936	The water was wide here, at least a kilometer from shore to shore, and
3937	its green and lapis sheen echoed the sky. At first glance the Consul
3938	did not recognize the land on either side of the river. To the east,
3939	periscope-bean paddies stretched away into the haze of distance where
3940	the rising sun reflected on a thousand flooded surfaces.
3941	A few indigenie huts were visible at the junction of paddy dikes, their
3942	angled walls made of bleached weirwood or golden half oak. To the west,
3943	the bottomland along the river was overgrown with low tangles of gissen,
3944	woman-grove root, and a flamboyant red fern the Consul did not
3945	recognize, all growing around mud marshes and miniature lagoons which
3946	stretched another kilometer or so to bluffs where scrub everblues clung
3947	to any bare spot between granite slabs.
3948	For a second the Consul felt lost, disoriented on a world he thought he
3949	knew well, but then he remembered the klaxon at the Karla Locks and
3950	realized that they had entered a rarely used stretch of the Hoolie north
3951	of Doukhobor's Copse. The Consul had never seen this part of the river,
3952	having always traveled on or flown above the Royal Transport Canal which
3953	lay to the west of the bluffs. He could only surmise that some danger
3954	or disturbance along the main route to the Sea of Grass had sent them
3955	this back way along bypassed stretches of the Hoolie. He guessed that
3956	they were about a hundred and eighty kilometers northwest of Keats.
3957	'It looks different in the daylight, doesn't it?" said Father Hoyt.
3958	The Consul looked at the shore again, not sure what Hoyt was talking
3959	about; then he realized the priest meant the barge.
3960	It had been strange - following the android messenger
3961	in the rain, boarding the old barge, making their way through its maze
3962	of tessellated rooms and passages, picking up Het Masteen at the ruins
3963	of the Temple, and then watching the lights of Keats fall astern.
3964	The Consul remembered those hours before and after midnight as from a
3965	fatigue-blurred dream, and he imagined the others must have been just as
3966	exhausted and disoriented. He vaguely remembered his surprise that the
3967	barge's crew were all android, but mostly he recalled his relief at
3968	finally closing the door of his stateroom and crawling into bed.
3969	'l was talking to A. Bettik this morning,' said Weintraub, referring to
3970	the android who had been their guide. 'This old scow has quite a
3971	history."
3972	Martin Silenus moved to the sideboard to pour himself more tomato juice,
3973	added a dash of something from the flask he carried, and said, 'It's
3974	obviously been around a bit. The goddamn railings've been oiled by
3975	hands, the stairs worn by feet, the ceilings darkened by lamp soot, and
3976	the beds beaten saggy by generations of humping.
3977	I'd say it's several centuries old. The carvings and rococo finishes
3978	are fucking marvelous. Did you notice that under all the other scents
3979	the inlaid wood still smells of sandalwood? I wouldn't be surprised if
3980	this thing came from Old Earth."
3981	'It does,' said Sol Weintraub. The baby, Rachel, slept on his arm,
3982	softly blowing bubbles of saliva in her sleep.
3983	'We're on the proud ship Benares, built in and named after the Old Earth
3984	city of the same name."
3985	'I don't remember hearing of any Old Earth city with that name,' said
3986	the Consul.
3987	Brawne Lamia looked up from the last of her breakfast.
3988	'Benares, also known as Varanasi or Gandhipur, Hindi Free State. Part
3989	of the Second Asian Co-prosperity Sphere after the Third Sino-Japanese
3990	War.
3991	Destroyed in the lndo-Soviet Muslim Republic Limited Exchange."
3992	'Yes,' said Weintraub, 'the Benares was built quite some time before the
3993	Big Mistake. Mid-twenty-second century, I would guess. A. Bettik
3994	informs me that it was originally a levitation barge..."
3995	'Are the EM generators still down there?" interrupted Colonel Kassad.
3996	'I believe so,' said Weintraub. 'Next to the main salon on the lowest
3997	deck. The floor of the salon is clear lunar crystal. Quite nice if we
3998	were cruising at two thousand meters... quite useless now."
3999	'Benares,' mused Martin Silenus. He ran his hand lovingly across a
4000	time-darkened railing. 'I was robbed there once."
4001	Brawne Lamia put down her coffee mug. 'Old man, are you trying to tell
4002	us that you're ancient enough to remember Old Earth? We're not fools,
4003	you know."
4004	'My dear child,' beamed Martin Silenus, 'I am not trying to tell you
4005	anything. I just thought it might be entertaining - as well as edifying
4006	and enlightening - if at some point we exchanged lists of all the
4007	locations at which we have either robbed or been robbed. Since you have
4008	the unfair advantage of having been the daughter of a senator, I am sure
4009	that your list would be much more distinguished... and much longer."
4010	Lamia opened her mouth to retort, frowned, and said nothing.
4011	"i wonde how this ship got to Hyperion?" murmured Father Hoyt. 'Why
4012	bring a levitation barge to a world where EM equipment doesn't work?"
4013	'It would work,' said Colonel Kassad. 'Hyperion has some magnetic
4014	field. It just would not be reliable in holding anything airborne."
4015	Father Hoyt raised an eyebrow, obviously at a loss to see the
4016	distinction.
4017	'Hey,' cried the poet from his place at the railing, 'the gang's all
4018	here!'
4019	'So?" said Brawne Lamia. Her lips all but disappeared into a thin line
4020	whenever she spoke to Silenus.
4021	'So we're all here,' he said. 'Let's get on with the storytelling."
4022	Het Masteen said, 'I thought it had been agreed that we would tell our
4023	respective stories after the dinner hour."
4024	Martin Silenus shrugged. 'Breakfast, dinner, who the
4025	fuck cares? We're assembled. It's not going to take six or seven days
4026	to get to the Time Tombs, is it?"
4027	The Consul considered. Less than two days to get as far as the river
4028	could take them. Two more days, or less if the winds were right, on the
4029	Sea of Grass. Certainly no more than one more day to cross the
4030	mountains. 'No,' he said. 'Not quite six days.
4031	'All right,' said Silenus, 'then let's get on with the telling of tales.
4032	Besides, there's no guarantee that the Shrike won't come calling before
4033	We knock on his door.
4034	If these bedtime stories are supposed to be helpful to our survival
4035	chances in some way, then I say let's hear from everyone before the
4036	contributors start getting chopped and diced by that ambulatory food
4037	processor we're so eager to visit."
4038	'You're disgusting,' said Brawne Lamia.
4039	'Ah, darling,' smiled Silenus, 'those are the same words you whispered
4040	last night after your second orgasm."
4041	Lamia looked away. Father Hoyt cleared his throat and said, 'Whose turn
4042	is it? To tell a story, I mean?" The silence stretched.
4043	'Mine,' said Fedmahn Kassad. The tall man reached into the pocket of
4044	his white tunic and held up a slip of paper with a large 2 scribbled on
4045	it.
4046	'Do you mind doing this now?" asked Sol Weintraub.
4047	Kassad showed a hint of a smile. 'I wasn't'in favor of doing it at
4048	all,' he said, 'but if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it
4049	were done quickly."
4050	'Hey!" cried Martin Silenus. 'The man knows his pre-Hegira
4051	playwrights."
4052	'Shakespeare?" said Father Hoyt.
4053	'No,' said Silenus. 'Lerner and fucking Lowe. Neii buggering Simon.
4054	Hamel fucking Posten."
4055	'Colonel,' Sol Weintraub said formally, 'the weather is nice, none of us
4056	seems to have anything pressing to do in the next hour or so, and we
4057	would be obliged if you would share the tale of what brings you to
4058	Hyperion on the Shrike's last pilgrimage."
4059	Kassad nodded. The day grew warmer as the canvas awning snapped, the
4060	decks creaked, and the levitation
4061	barge Benares worked its steady way upstream toward the mountains, the
4062	moors, and the Shrike.
4063	THE SOLDIER'S TALE: The War Lovers
4064	It was during the Battle of Agincourt that Fedmahn Kassad encountered
4065	the woman he would spend the rest of his life seeking.
4066	It was a wet and chilly late October morning in A.D.
4067	I4I5. Kassad had been inserted as an archer into the army of Henry V of
4068	England. The English force had been on French soil since August I4 and
4069	had been retreating from superior French forces since October 8.
4070	Henry had convinced his War Council that the army could bent the French
4071	in a forced march to the safety of Calais. They had failed. Now, as
4072	October 25 dawned gray and drizzly, seven thousand Englishmen, mostly
4073	bowmen, faced a force of some twenty-eight thousand French men-at-arms
4074	across a kilometer of muddy field. '
4075	Kassad was cold, tired sick, and scared. He and the other archers had
4076	been surviving on little more than scavenged berries for the past week
4077	of the march and almost every man on the line that morning was suffering
4078	from diarrhea. The air temperature was in the low fifties Fahrenheit
4079	and Kassad had spent a long night trying to sleep on damp ground. He
4080	was impressed with the unbelievable realism of the experience- the
4081	Olympus Command School Historical Tactical Network was as far beyond
4082	regular stimsims as full-form holos were beyond tintypes - but the
4083	physical sensations were so convincing, so real, that Kassad did not
4084	relish the thought of being wounded. There were tales of cadets
4085	receiving fatal wounds in the OCS:HTN sims and being pulled dead from
4086	their immersion creches.
4087	Kassad and the other bowmen on Henry's right flank had been staring at
4088	the larger French force for most of the morning when pennants waved, the
4089	fifteenth-century equivalent of sergeants brayed, and the archers obeyed
4090	the King's command and began marching against the
4091	enemy. The ragged English line, stretching about seven hundred meters
4092	across the field from treeline to treeline, consisted of clusters of
4093	archers like Kassad's troop interspersed with smaller groups of
4094	men-at-arms. The English had no formal cavalry and most of the horses
4095	Kassad could see on his end of the field were carrying men clustered
4096	near the King's command group three hundred meters toward the center, or
4097	huddled around the Duke of York's position much closer to where Kassad
4098	and the other archers stood near the right flank. These command groups
4099	reminded Kassad of a FORCE:ground mobile staff HQ, only instead of the
4100	inevitable forest of comm antennae giving away their position, bright
4101	banners and pennants hung limp on pikes. An obvious artillery target,
4102	thought Kassad, and then reminded himself that this particular military
4103	nuance did not yet exist.
4104	Kassad noticed that the French had plenty of horses.
4105	He estimated six or seven hundred mounted men formed in ranks on each of
4106	the French flanks and a long line of cavalry behind the main battle
4107	line. Kassad did not like horses. He had seen holos and pictures, of
4108	course, but he had not encountered the animals themselves until this
4109	exercise, and the size, smell, and sound of them tended to be unnerving
4110	- especially so when the damn quadrupeds were armored chest and head,
4111	shod in steel, and trained to carry armored men wielding four meters of
4112	lance.
4113	The English advance halted. Kassad estimated that his battle line was
4114	about two hundred and fifty meters from the French. He knew from the
4115	experience of the past week that this was within longbow range, but he
4116	also knew that he would have to pull his arm half out of its socket to
4117	hold the pull.
4118	The French were shouting what Kassad assumed were insults. He ignored
4119	them as he and his silent comrades stepped forward from where they had
4120	planted their long arrows and found soft ground in which to drive their
4121	stakes. The stakes were long and heavy and Kassad had been carrying his
4122	for a week. Almost a meter and a half long, the clumsy thing had been
4123	sharpened at both ends.
4124	When the order first came down for all archers to find saplings and cut
4125	stakes, somewhere in the deep woods
4126	just after they had crossed the Somme, Kassad had wondered idly what the
4127	things were for. Now he knew.
4128	Every third archer carried a heavy mallet nnd now they took tums driving
4129	their stakes in at a careful angle.
4130	Kassad pulled out his long knife, resharpened the end which, even
4131	leaning, rose almost to his chest, and stepped back through the hedgehog
4132	of sharpened stakes to await the French charge.
4133	The French did not charge.
4134	Kassad waited with the others. His bow was strung, forty-eight arrows
4135	were planted in two clusters at his
4136	feet, and his feet were set properly.
4137	The French did not charge.
4138	The rain had stopped but a cool breeze had come up and what little body
4139	heat Kassad had generated by the short march and the task of driving
4140	stakes had been lost quickly. The only sounds were the metallic
4141	shufflings of men and horses, occasional mutterings or nervous laughs,
4142	and the heavier thud of hooves as the French cavalry rearranged itself
4143	but still refused to charge.
4144	'Fuck this,' said a gri,.led yeoman a few feet from Kassad. 'Those
4145	bastards've wasted our whole bleeding morning. They'd better piss or
4146	get off the pot."
4147	Kassad nodded. He was not sure if he was hearing and understanding
4148	Middle English or if the sentence had been in simple Standard. He had
4149	no idea if the grizzled archer was another Command School cadet, an
4150	instructor, or merely an artifact of the sire. He could not guess if
4151	the slang had been correct. He did not care. His heart was pounding
4152	and his palms were sweaty. He wiped his hands on his jerkin.
4153	As if King Henry had taken his cue from the old man's muttering, command
4154	flags suddenly bobbed and rose, sergeants screamed, and row upon row of
4155	English archers raised their longbows, pulled when commands were
4156	shouted, released on the next command.
4157	Four waves of arrows comprised of more than six thousand meter-long,
4158	chisel-pointed, clothyard missiles rose, seemed to hang in a cloud
4159	thirty meters up, and fell on the French.
4160	There came the sound of horses screaming and a
4161	thousand demented children pounding on ten thousand tin pots as the
4162	French men-at-arms leaned into the rain of arrows to let their steel
4163	helmets and their chest and shoulder armor take the brunt of the
4164	downpour. Kassad knew that in military terms little real damage had
4165	been done, but this was small solace to the occasional French soldier
4166	with ten inches of arrow through his eye, or to the scores of horses
4167	leaping, tumbling, and crashing into one another while their riders
4168	struggled to remove wooden
4169	shafts from the creatures' backs and flanks.
4170	The French did not charge.
4171	More commands were shouted. Kassad raised, read-led, loosed his arrow.
4172	Again. And again. The sky darkened every ten seconds. Kassad's arm
4173	and back ached from the punishing rhythm. He found that he felt neither
4174	elation nor anger. He was doing his job. His forearm was raw. Again
4175	the arrows flew. And again. Fifteen of his first sheaf of twenty-four
4176	arrows were gone when a cry went up along the English line and Kassad
4177	paused and glanced down while holding full pull.
4178	The French were charging.
4179	A cavalry charge was something beyond Kassad's experience.
4180	Watching twelve hundred armored horses charging directly at him created
4181	internal sensations which Kassad found a bit unnerving. The charge took
4182	less than forty seconds but Kassad discovered that this was ample time
4183	for his mouth to go absolutely dry, his breathing to begin to have
4184	problems, and for his testicles to retreat completely into his body. If
4185	the rest of Kassad could have found a comparable hiding place, he would
4186	have seriously considered crawling into it.
4187	As it was, he was too busy to run.
4188	Firing on command, his line of archers got off five flat volleys at the
4189	attacking horsemen, managed one more shot in independent fire, and then
4190	they fell back five paces.
4191	Horses, it turned out, were too smart to willingly impale themselves
4192	upon stakes- no matter how hard their human riders implored them to do
4193	so- but the second and third waves of cavalry did not stop as
4194	abruptly as the first, and in a single mad moment horses were down and
4195	screaming, riders were thrown and screaming, and Kassad was out and
4196	screaming, rushing at every downed Frenchman he could see, wielding a
4197	mallet on the prostrate form when he could, slashing through gaps in
4198	armor with his long knife when it was too crowded to swing the mallet.
4199	Soon he and the grizzled archer and a younger man who had lost his cap
4200	became an efficient killing team, closing in on a downed rider from
4201	three sides, Kassad using the mallet to knock the pleading horseman off
4202	his knees, then all three moving in with their blades.
4203	Only one knight gained his feet and raised a sword to confront them. The
4204	Frenchman flipped up his visor and called out a clear request for honor
4205	and single combat.
4206	The old man and the youth circled like wolves. Kassad returned with his
4207	bow and put an arrow into the knight's left eye from ten paces.
4208	The battle continued in the deadly comic-opera vein common to all armed
4209	combat since the first rock and thighbone duels on Old Earth. The
4210	French cavalry managed to turn and flee just as the first wave of ten
4211	thousand men-at-arms charged the English center on foot.
4212	The melee broke up the rhythm of the attack and, by the time the French
4213	had regained their initiative, Henry's own men-at-arms had braced to
4214	hold them at pike length while Kassad and several thousand other archers
4215	poured volley fire into the massed French infantry at close range.
4216	That did not end the battle. It was not necessarily even the decisive
4217	moment. The turning point, when it came, was lost - as all such moments
4218	are - within the dust and turmoil of a thousand individual encounters
4219	where infantrymen faced infantrymen across the distance of their
4220	personal weapons. Before it was over some three hours later there would
4221	be minor variations on repeated themes, ineffective thrusts and clumsy
4222	counterthrusts, and a less than honorable moment when Henry would order
4223	prisoners killed rather than leave them in the rear when the English
4224	were confronted with a new threat. But the heralds and historians would
4225	later agree that the
4226	outcome had been sealed somewhere in the confusion during the first
4227	French infantry charge. The French died in their thousands. English
4228	dominion on that part of the Continent would continue for a while. The
4229	day of the armored man-at-arms, the knight, the embodiment of ·
4230	chivalry, was over - hammered into history's coffin by a few thousand
4231	ragtag peasant archers carrying longbows.
4232	The ultimate insult to the noble-born French dead - if the dead indeed
4233	could be further insulted - lay in the fact that the English archers
4234	were not only common men, common in the lowest, most flea-infested sense
4235	of the word, but that they were draftees. Doughboys. Gls.
4236	Grunts. AIPs. Spezzes. K-techs. Jump Rats.
4237	But all that was in the lesson Kassad was supposed to have learned
4238	during the OCS:HTN exercise. He learned none of it. He was too busy
4239	having an encounter which would change his life.
4240	The French man-at-arms went over the head of his falling horse, rolled
4241	once, and was up and running for the woods before the mud quit flying.
4242	Kassad followed. He was halfway to the tree line before he realized
4243	that the youth and the griTsled archer had not come with him. It did
4244	not matter. Kassad's adrenaline was flowing and the bloodlust had him
4245	in its grip.
4246	The man-at-arms, who had just been thrown to the ground from a horse
4247	moving at full gallop and who was wearing sixty pounds of clumsy armor,
4248	should have been an easy prey to catch. He was not. The Frenchman
4249	glanced back once, saw Kassad coming on a full run with a mallet in his
4250	hand and his eye full of business, and then the man-at-arms shifted into
4251	a higher gear and reached the trees fifteen meters ahead of his pursuer.
4252	Kassad was deep into the woods before he stopped, leaned on the mallet,
4253	gasped, and considered his position.
4254	Thuds, screams, and crashes from the battlefield behind him were muffled
4255	by distance and shrubbery.
4256	The trees were almost bare and still dripped from the rainstorm the
4257	night before; the floor of the forest was carpeted with a thick layer of
4258	old leaves and a snarl of shrubs and brambles. The man-at-arms had left
4259	a trail of
4260	broken branches and footprints for the first twenty meters or so, but
4261	now deer trails and overgrown paths made it difficult to see where he
4262	had passed.
4263	Kassad moved slowly, stepping deeper into the woods, trying to be alert
4264	for any noise above the sound of his own panting and the insane pounding
4265	of his heart. It occurred to Kassad that, tactically speaking, this was
4266	not a brilliant move; the man-at-arms had been wearing full armor and
4267	carrying his sword when he disappeared in the bushes. At any moment the
4268	Frenchman might forget his panic, regret his temporary loss of honor,
4269	and remember his years of combat training. Kassad also had been
4270	trained. He looked down at his cloth shirt and leather vest. The
4271	mallet was still in his hands, the knife in his broad belt. He had been
4272	trained to use high-energy weapons with a killing range of a few meters
4273	to thousands of kilometers. He had been rated in plasma grenades,
4274	he!l-whips, fleschette rifles, sonics, recoilless zero-gravity weapons,
4275	deathwands, kinetic assault guns, and beam gauntlets. He now had a
4276	working knowledge of an English longbow. None of these objects-
4277	including the longbow - was on his person at the moment.
4278	'Ah, shit,' murmured Second Lieutenant Kassad.
4279	The man-at-arms came out of the bushes like a charging bear, arms up,
4280	legs apart, the sword coming around in a flat arc meant to disembowel
4281	Kassad. The OCS cadet tried to leap back and raise his mallet at the
4282	same time.
4283	Neither effort was completely successful. The Frenchman's sword knocked
4284	the heavy mallet out of Kassad's grip while the dull point of the blade
4285	slashed through leather, shirt, and skin. ·
4286	Kassad bellowed and stumbled backward again, tugging at the knife in his
4287	belt. His right heel caught the branch of a fallen tree and he went
4288	down backward, cursing and rolling deeper into the tangle of branches as
4289	the man-at-arms crashed forward, his heavy sword clearing limbs like an
4290	oversized machete. Kassad had his knife out by the time the man=at-arms
4291	had cleared a path through the deadfall, but the ten-inch blade was a
4292	pitiful thing against armor unless the knight was helpless. This knight
4293	was not helpless. Kassad knew that he would
4294	never get inside the arc of sword blade. His only hope was in running,
4295	but the tall trunk of the fallen tree behind him and the deadfall beyond
4296	eliminated that option. He did not wish to get cut down from behind as
4297	he turned.
4298	Nor from below as he climbed. Kassad did not wish to be cut down from
4299	any angle.
4300	Kassad went into a knife fighter's crouch which he hadn't used since his
4301	street-fighting days in the Tharsis slums. He wondered how the
4302	simulation would deal with his death.
4303	The figure appeared behind the man-at-arms like a sudden shadow. The
4304	noise of Kassad's mallet striking the knight's armored shoulder sounded
4305	precisely like someone bashing the hood of an EMV with a sledge-hammer.
4306	The Frenchman staggered, turned to meet the new threat, and took a
4307	second mallet below in the chest.
4308	Kassad's savior was small; the man-at-arms did not go down. The French
4309	knight was raising his sword above his head when Kassad hit him behind
4310	and below the knees with a shoulder tackle.
4311	Tree limbs snapped as the Frenchman went down. The small attacker stood
4312	astride the knight, pinning the armored man's sword arm with one foot
4313	while bringing the mallet down repeatedly onto helmet and visor.
4314	Kassad extricated himself from the tangle of legs and branches, sat on
4315	the downed man's knees, and began slashing through gaps in armor at
4316	groin, sides, and underarms. Kassad's rescuer jumped aside to plant
4317	both feet on the knight's wrist and Kassad scrambled forward, stabbing
4318	through crevices where the helmet met chest armor, finally slamming the
4319	blade through slits in the visor itself.
4320	The knight screamed as the mallet came down a final time, almost
4321	catching Kassad's hand as the hammer drove the blade through the visor
4322	slit like a ten-inch tent peg. The man-at-arms arched,'lifting Kassad
4323	and sixty pounds of armor clear of the ground in a final violent spasm
4324	and then fell back limply.
4325	Kassad rolled onto his side. His rescuer collapsed beside him. Both
4326	were covered with sweat and the dead
4327	man's blood. Kassad looked at his savior. The woman was dressed in
4328	clothes not dissimilar to Kassad's. For a moment they merely lay there
4329	and gasped for air.
4330	'Are you... all fight?" Kassad managed after a while.
4331	He was suddenly struck by her appearance. Her brown hair was short by
4332	current Worldweb fashion, short and straight and cut so that the longest
4333	strands fell from the part, just a few centimeters left of the center of
4334	her forehead, to just above her right ear. It was a boy's haircut from
4335	some forgotten time, but she was no boy. Kassad thought that she was
4336	perhaps the most beautiful woman he had ever seen: bone structure so
4337	perfect that chin and cheekbones were shaped without being too sharp,
4338	large eyes glowing with life and intelligence, a gentle mouth with a
4339	soft underlip. Lying next to her, Kassad realized that she was tall -
4340	not so tall as he but obviously not a woman from the fifteenth century -
4341	and even under her of the tunic and baggy trousers he could see the soft
4342	swell of hipg and breast. She appeared to be a few years older than
4343	Kassad, perhaps in her late twenties, but this fact barely registered as
4344	she continued staring into his face with those soft, beguiling,
4345	endlessly deep eyes.
4346	'Are you all right?" he asked again. His voice sounded strange, even to
4347	himself.
4348	She did not answer. Or, rather, she answered by sliding long fingers
4349	across Kassad's chest, ripping away the leather thongs which bound the
4350	rough vest. Her hands found his shirt. It was soaked with blood and
4351	ripped halfway down the front. The woman ripped it open the rest Of the
4352	way. She moved against him now, her fingers and lips on his chest, hips
4353	already beginning to move.
4354	Her fight hand found the cords to his trouser front, ripped them free.
4355	Kassad helped her pull off the rest of his clothes, removed hers with
4356	three fluid movements. She wore nothing under her shirt and
4357	coarse-cloth trousers.
4358	Kassad's hand slid between her thighs, behind her, cupped her moving
4359	buttocks, pulled her closer, and slid to the moist roughness in front.
4360	She opened to him, her mouth closing on his. Somehow, with all of their
4361	motion and disrobing, their skin never lost contact. Kassad felt
4362	his own excitement rubbing against the cusp of her belly.
4363	She rolled above him then, her thighs astride his hips, her gaze still
4364	locked with his. Kassad had never been so excited. He gasped as her
4365	right hand went behind her, found him, guided him into her. When he
4366	opened his eyes again she was moving slowly, her head back, eyes closed.
4367	Kassad's hands moved up her sides to cup her perfect breasts. Nipples
4368	hardened against his palms.
4369	They made love then. Kassad, at twenty-three standard years, had been
4370	in love once and had enjoyed sex many times. He thought he knew the way
4371	and the why of it. There was nothing in his experience to that moment
4372	which he could not have described with a phrase and a laugh to his
4373	squadmates in the hold of a troop transport.
4374	With the calm, sure cynicism of a twenty-three-year-old veteran he was
4375	sure that he would never experience anything that could not be so
4376	described, so dismissed. He was wrong. He could never adequately share
4377	the sense of the next few minutes with anyone else. He would never try.
4378	They made love in a sudden shaft of late October light with a carpet of
4379	leaves and clothes beneath them and a film of blood and sweat oiling the
4380	sweet friction between them. Her green eyes stared down at Kassad,
4381	widening slightly when he began moving quickly, closing at the same
4382	second he closed his.
4383	They moved together then in the sudden tide of sensation as old and
4384	inevitable as the movement of worlds: pulses racing, flesh quickening
4385	with its own moist purposes, a further, final rising together, the world
4386	receding to nothing at all - and then, still joined by touch and
4387	heartbeat and the fading thrill of passion, allowing consciousness to
4388	slide back to separate flesh while the world flowed in through forgotten
4389	senses.
4390	They lay next to each other. The dead man's armor was cold against
4391	Kassad's left, arm, her thigh warm against his right leg. The sunlight
4392	was a benediction.
4393	Hidden colors rose to the surface of things. Kassad turned his head and
4394	gazed at her as she rested her head on his shoulder. Her cheeks
4395	glowed with flush and autumn light and her hair lay like copper threads
4396	along the flesh
4397	of his arm. She curved her leg over his thigh and Kassad felt the
4398	clockwise stirring of renewed passion. The sun was warm on his face. He
4399	closed his eyes.
4400	When he awoke she was gone. He was certain that only seconds had passed
4401	- no more than a minute, certainly -but the sunlight was gone, colors
4402	had flowed out of the forest, and a cool evening breeze moved bare
4403	branches.
4404	Kassad dressed in torn clothes made stiff with blood.
4405	The French man-at-arms lay still and rigid in the unselfconscious
4406	attitude of death. He already seemed inanimate, a part of the forest.
4407	There was no sign whatsoever of the woman.
4408	Fedmahn Kassad !imPed his way back through the woods, evening gloom, and
4409	a sudden, chilling drizzle.
4410	The battlefield still held people, living and dead. The dead lay in
4411	heaps like the piles of toy soldiers Kassad had played with as a child.
4412	Wounded men moved slowly with the help of friends. Here and there
4413	furtive forms picked their way among the dead, and near the opposite
4414	tree line a lively group of heralds, both French and English, met in
4415	conclave with much pointing and animated conversation.
4416	Kassad knew that they had to decide upon a name for the battle so that
4417	their respective records would agree. He also knew that they would
4418	settle on the name of the nearest castle, Agincourt, even though it had
4419	figured in neither strategy nor battle.
4420	Kassad was beginning to think that this was no simulation, that his life
4421	in the Worldweb was the dream and that this gray day had to be reality,
4422	when suddenly the entire scene froze with outlines of human figures,
4423	horses, and the darkening forest becoming as transparent as a fading
4424	holo. And then Kassad was being helPed out of his simulation creche at
4425	the Olympus Command School and the other cadets and instructors were
4426	rising, talking, laughing with one another - all seemingly unaware that
4427	the world had changed forever.
4428	For weeks Kassad sPent every free hour wandering the Command School
4429	grounds, watching from the ramparts as the evening shadow of Mons
4430	Olympus covered first
4431	the Plateau forest, then the heavily settled highlands, then everything
4432	halfway to the horizon, and then all the world. And every second he
4433	thought about what had hapPened. He thought about her.
4434	No one else had noticed anything strange in the simulation.
4435	No one else had left the battlefield. One instructor explained that
4436	nothing beyond the battlefield ex/sted in that particular segment of the
4437	simulation. No one had missed Kassad. It was as if the incident in the
4438	forest - and the woman - had never happened.
4439	Kassad knew better. He attended his classes on military history and
4440	mathematics. He put in his hours at the firing range and gym. He
4441	walked off barracks punishments on the Caldera Quadrangle, although
4442	these were rare. In general, young Kassad became an even more excellent
4443	officer cadet than he had been. But all the while he waited.
4444	And then she came again.
4445	Again it was in the final hours of an OCS:HTN simulation.
4446	By then Kassad had learned that the exercises were something more than
4447	mere simulations. The OCS:HTN was part of the Worldweb All Thing, the
4448	real-time network which governed Hegemony politics, fed information to
4449	tens of billions of data-hungry citizens, and had evolved a form of
4450	autonomy and consciousness all its own. More than a hundred and fifty
4451	planetary data-spheres mingled their resources within the framework
4452	created by six thousand omega-class Als to allow the OCS:HTN to
4453	function.
4454	'The HTN stuff doesn't simulate,' whined Cadet Radinski, the best AI
4455	exPert Kassad could find and bribe to explain, 'it dreams, dreams with
4456	the best historical accuracy in the Web - way beyond the sum of its
4457	parts 'cause it plugs in holistic insight as well as facts - and when it
4458	dreams, it lets us dream with it."
4459	Kassad had not understood but he had believed. And then she came again.
4460	In the First US-Vietnam War they made love in the aftermath of an ambush
4461	during the darkness and terror of a night patrol. Kassad wore rough
4462	camouflage
4463	clothes- with no underwear because of the jungle crotch rot - and a
4464	steel helmet not much more advanced than those at Agincourt. She wore
4465	black pajamas and sandals, the universal garb of the Southeast Asian
4466	peasant.
4467	And the Viet Cong. Then neither of them wore anything as they made love
4468	standing in the night, her back against a tree and her legs wrapped
4469	around him, while beyond them the world exploded in the green glow of
4470	perimeter flares and the sputter-crack of claymores.
4471	She came to him on the second day of Gettysburg and again at Borodino,
4472	where the clouds of powder smoke hung above the piles of bodies like a
4473	vapor congealed from departing souls.
4474	They made love in the shattered hulk of an APC in Hellas Basin while the
4475	hovertank battle still raged and the red dust of the approaching simoon
4476	scraped and shrieked at the titanium hull. 'Tell me your name,' he had
4477	whispered in Standard. She shook her head. 'Are you real- outside the
4478	simulation?" he asked in the Japanese-English of that era. She had
4479	nodded and leaned closer to kiss him.
4480	They lay together in a sheltered place among the ruins of Brasilia while
4481	deathbeams from Chinese EMVs played like blue searchlights on broken
4482	ceramic walls.
4483	During an unnamed battle after a siege of a forgotten tower city on the
4484	Russian steppes, he pulled her back into the shattered room where they
4485	had made love, and he whiSpered, 'I want to stay with you." She touched
4486	his lips with a finger and shook her head. After the evacuation of New
4487	Chicago, as they lay on the hundredth-floor balcony where Kassad had set
4488	his sniper's nest for the last US President's hopeless rear-guard
4489	action, he placed his hand on the warm flesh between her breasts and
4490	said, 'Can you ever join me... out there?" She touched his cheek with
4491	her palm and smiled.
4492	During the last year in Command School there were only five OCS:HTN sims
4493	as the cadets' training shifted to live field exercises. Sometimes, as
4494	when Kitssad was strapped into the tactical command chair during a
4495	battalion-sized drop onto Ceres, he closed his eyes, looked between the
4496	primary-colored geographies of the
4497	cortically generated tactical/terrain matrix, and felt a sense of...
4498	someone? Of her? He was not sure.
4499	And then she did not come again. Not in the final months of work. Not
4500	in the final simulation of the great Coal Sack Battle where General
4501	Horace Glennon-Height's mutiny was defeated. Not during the parades and
4502	parties of graduation, nor as the class marched in a final Olympian
4503	review before the Hegemony CEO, saluting from his red-lit levitation
4504	deck.
4505	And there was no time even for dreaming as the young officers farcast to
4506	Earth's Moon for the Masada Ceremony, farcast again to Tau Ceti Center
4507	for their formal swearing-in to FORCE, and then they were finished.
4508	Second Lieutenant Cadet Kassad became Lieutenant Kassad, spent three
4509	standard weeks free in the Web with a FORCE-issued universal card which
4510	allow him to farcast as far and as frequently as he wished, and then he
4511	was shipped out to the Hegemony Colonial Service training school on
4512	Lusus to prepare for active duty beyond the Web. He was sure that he
4513	would never see her again.
4514	He was wrong.
4515	Fedmahn Kassad had grown up in a culture of poverty and sudden death. As
4516	a member of the minority who still called themselves Palestinians, he
4517	and his family had lived in the slums of Tharsis, human testimony to the
4518	bitter legacy of the terminally dispossessed. Every Palestinian in the
4519	Worldweb and beyond carried the cul-turai memory of a century of
4520	struggle capped by a month of nationalist triumph before the Nuclear
4521	Jihad of 2038 wiped it all away. Then came their second Diaspora, this
4522	one lasting five centuries and leading to dead-end desert worlds like
4523	Mars, their dream buried with the death of Old Earth.
4524	Kassad, like the .other boys of the South Tharsis Relocation Camps,
4525	either ran with gangs or faced the option of being prey to every
4526	self-proclaimed predator in the camps. He chose to run with the gangs.
4527	Kassad had killed another youth by the time he was sixteen standard
4528	years old.
4529	If Mars was known for anything in the Worldweb, it
4530	was for hunting in the Mariner Valley, Schrauder's Zen Massif in Hellas
4531	Basin, and the Olympus Command School. Kassad did not have to travel to
4532	Mariner Valley to learn about hunting and being hunted, he had no
4533	interest in Zen Gnosticism, and as a teenager he felt nothing but
4534	contempt for the uniformed cadets who came from every part of the Web to
4535	train for FORCE.
4536	He joined with his peers in sneering at the New Bushido as a code for
4537	faggots, but an ancient vein of honor in the young Kassad's soul
4538	secretly resonated to the thought of a samurai class whose life and work
4539	revolved around duty, self-respect, and the ultimate value of one's
4540	word.
4541	When Kassad was eighteen, a Tharsis Province higher circuit judge
4542	offered him the choice of a Martian year at polar work camp or
4543	volunteering for the John Carter Brigade then forming to help FORCE put
4544	down the resurgent Glennon-Height Rebellion in the Class Three colonies.
4545	Kassad volunteered and discovered that he enjoyed the discipline and
4546	cleanliness of military life, even though the John Carter Brigade saw
4547	only garrison duty within the Web and was dissolved shortly after
4548	G!ennon-Height's cloned grandson died on Renaissance.
4549	Two days after his nineteenth birthday, Kassad applied to FORCE:ground
4550	and was turned down. He
4551	· went on a nine-day drunk, awoke in one of the deeper hive tunnels of
4552	Lusus with his military cornlog implant stolen - by someone who
4553	apparently had taken a correspondence course in surgery-his universal
4554	card and farcaster access revoked, and his head exploring new frontiers
4555	of pain.
4556	Kassad worked on Lusus for a standard year, saving over six thousand
4557	marks and allowing physical labor in the I.3-ES gravity to put an end to
4558	his Martian frailness.
4559	By the time he used his savings to ship out to Maul-Covenant on an
4560	ancient solar sail freighter with jury-rigged Hawking drives, Kassad was
4561	still lean and tall by Web standards, but what muscles there were worked
4562	wonderfully well by anyone's standards.
4563	He arrived on Mani-Covenant three days before the vicious and unpopular
4564	Island War began there, and eventually the FORCE: combined commander at
4565	Firstsite
4566	got so tired of seeing the young Kassad waiting in his outer office that
4567	he allowed the boy to enlist in the 23rd Supply Regiment as an assistant
4568	hydrofoil driver. Eleven standard months later, Corporal Fedmahn Kassad
4569	of the Twelfth Mobile Infantry Battalion had received two Distinguished
4570	Service Clusters, a Senate Commendation for valor in the Equatorial
4571	Archipelago campaign, and two Purple Hearts. He was also tapped for
4572	FORCE command school and shipped Webward on the next convoy.
4573	Kassad dreamed of her often. He had never learned her name, she had
4574	never spoken, but he could have recognized her touch and scent in total
4575	darkness among a thousand others. He thought of her as Mystery.
4576	When other young officers went whoring or seeking girlfriends in the
4577	indigenie populations, Kassad would remain on base or take long walks
4578	through strange cities.
4579	He kept his obsession with Mystery secret, knowing full well how it
4580	would read on a psych report. Sometimes, on bivouac under multiple
4581	moons or in the womblike zero-g of a troop transport hold, Kassad would
4582	realize how insane his love affair with a phantom truly was. But then
4583	he would recall the small mole under her left breast which he had kissed
4584	one night, feeling her heartbeat under his lips as the ground itself
4585	shook from the firing of the big guns near Verdun. He would remember
4586	the impatient gesture with which she brushed back her hair as her cheek
4587	rested on his thigh. And the young officers would go to town or to the
4588	huts near the base, and Fedmahn Kassad would read another history book
4589	or jog along the perimeter or run tactical strategies on his comiog.
4590	It was not long before Kassad came to the attention of his superiors.
4591	During the undeclared war with the Free Miners in the Lambert Ring
4592	Territories, it was Lieutenant Kassad who led the surviving infantry
4593	troops and Marine guards in cutting through the bottom of the old
4594	asteroid bore shaft on Peregrine to evacuate the Hegemony consulate
4595	staff and citizens.
4596	But it was during the short reign of the New Prophet
4597	on Qom-Riyadh that Captain Fedmahn Kassad came to the attention of the
4598	entire Web.
4599	The FORCE:space captain of the only Hegemony ship within two leap years
4600	of the colony world had been paying a courtesy call when the New Prophet
4601	chose to lead thirty million New Order Shi'ites against two continents
4602	of Suni shopkeepers and ninety thousand resident Hegemony infidels. The
4603	ship's captain and five of his executive officers were taken prisoner.
4604	Urgent fatline messages from Tau Ceti Center demanded that the ranking
4605	officer aboard the orbiting HS Denieve settle the situation on
4606	Qom-Riyadh, free all hostages, and depose the New Prophet . . .
4607	without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons within the planet's
4608	atmosphere. The Denieve was an aging orbital defense picket. It
4609	carried no nuclear weapons that could be used within an atmosphere.
4610	The ranking officer on board was FORCE:combined Captain Fedmahn Kassad.
4611	On the third day of the revolution, Kassad landed the Denieve's single
4612	assault boat in the main courtyard of the Grand Mosque at Mashhad. He
4613	and the other thirty-four FORCE troopers watched as the mob grew to
4614	three hundred thousand militants kept at bay only by the boat's
4615	containment field and the lack of an order to attack by the New Prophet.
4616	The New Prophet himself was no longer in the Grand Mosque; he had flown
4617	to the northern hemisphere of Riyadh to join in the victory celebrations
4618	there.
4619	Two hours after he landed, Captain Kassad stepped out of his ship and
4620	broadcast a short announcement. He said that he had been raised as a
4621	Muslim. He also announced that interpretation of the Koran since the
4622	Shi'ites' seedship days had definitely shown that the God of Islam would
4623	neither condone nor allow the slaughter of the innocent, no matter how
4624	many jihads were proclaimed by tinhorn heretics like the New Prophet.
4625	Captain Kassad gave the leaders of the thirty million zealots three
4626	hours to surrender their hostages and return to their homes on the
4627	desert continent of Qom.
4628	In the first three days of the revolution the armies of the New Prophet
4629	had occupied most of the cities on two
4630	continents and had taken more than twenty-seven thousand Hegemony
4631	hostages. Firing squads had been busy day and night settling ancient
4632	theological disputes and it was estimated that at least a quarter of a
4633	million Sunis had been slaughtered in the first two days of the New
4634	Prophet's occupation. In response to Kassad's ultimatum, the New
4635	Prophet announced that all of the infidels would be put to death
4636	immediately following his live television address fhat evening. He also
4637	ordered an attack on Kassad's assault boat.
4638	Avoiding high explosives because of the Grand Mosque, the Revolutionary
4639	Guard used automatic weapons, crude energy cannon, plasma charges, and
4640	human wave attacks. The containment field held.
4641	The New Prophet's televised address began fifteen minutes before
4642	Kassad's ultimatum ran out. The New Prophet agreed with Kassad's
4643	statement that Allah would horribly punish heretics but announced that
4644	it was the Hegemony infidels who would be so punished. It was the only
4645	time the New Prophet ever had been seen to lose his temper on camera.
4646	Screaming, saliva flying, he ordered the human wave attacks to be
4647	renewed on the grounded assault boat. He announced that at that moment
4648	a dozen fission bombs were being assembled at the occupied Power for
4649	Peace reactor in All. With these, the forces of Allah would be carried
4650	into space itself. The first fission bomb, he explained, would be used
4651	on the infidel Kassad's satanic assault boat that very afternoon.
4652	The New Prophet then began to explain exactly how the Hegemony hostages
4653	would be executed, but at that moment Kassad's deadline ran out.
4654	Qom-Riyadh was, by its own choice and the accident of its distant
4655	location, a technically primitive world. But the inhabitants were not
4656	so primitive that they did not have an active datasphere. Nor were the
4657	revolutionary mullahs who had led the invasion so opposed to the 'Great
4658	Satan of Hegemony Science' that they refused to tie into the global data
4659	net with their personal cornlogs.
4660	The HS Denieve had seeded enough spysats so that by I729 hours
4661	Qom-Riyadh Central Time, the datasphere had been tapped to the point
4662	that the Hegemony ship had
4663	identified sixteen thousand eight hundred and thirty revolutionary
4664	muilahs by their access codes. At I729:30 hours the spysats began
4665	feeding their real-time targeting data to the twenty-one perimeter
4666	defense sats which Kassad's assault boat had left in low orbit. These
4667	orbital defense weapons were so old that the Denieve's mission had been
4668	to return them to the Web for safe destruction.
4669	Kassad had suggested another use for them.
4670	At precisely I730 hours, nineteen of the small satellites detonated
4671	their fusion cores. In the nanoseconds before their self-destruction,
4672	the resulting X rays were focused, aimed, and released in sixteen
4673	thousand eight hundred and thirty invisible but very coherent beams. The
4674	ancient defense sats were not designed for atmospheric use and had an
4675	effective destructive radius of less than a millimeter.
4676	Luckily, that was all that was needed. Not all of the targeting beams
4677	penetrated whatever stood between the mu!lahs and the sky. Fifteen
4678	thousand seven hundred and eighty-four did.
4679	The effect was immediate and dramatic. In each case the target's brain
4680	and cerebral fluid boiled, turned to vapor, and blew the encasing skull
4681	to bits. The New Prophet was in the middle of his live, planetwide
4682	broadcast - literally in the middle of pronouncing the word 'heretic' -
4683	when I730 hours arrived.
4684	For almost two minutes the TV screens and walls around the planet
4685	carried the image of the New Prophet's headless body slumped over the
4686	microphone. Then Fedmahn Kassad cut in on all bands to announce that
4687	his next deadline was one hour away and that any actions against the
4688	hostages would be met with a more dramatic
4689	demonstration of Allah's displeasure.
4690	There were no reprisals.
4691	That night, in orbit around Q0m-Riyadh, Mystery visited Kassad for the
4692	first time since his cadet days. He was asleep but the visit was more
4693	than a dream and less than the alternative reality of the OCS:HTN sims.
4694	The woman and he were lying together under a light blanket beneath a
4695	broken roof. Her skin was warm and electric, her face little more than
4696	a pale outline against nighttime darkness. Overhead the stars had just
4697	begun to fade into
4698	the false light of predawn. Kassad realized that she was trying to
4699	speak to him; her soft lips formed words which were just below the
4700	threshold of Kassad's hearing. He pulled back a second in order to see
4701	her face better and, in so doing, lost contact completely. He awoke in
4702	his sleep webbing with moisture on his cheeks and the hum of the ship's
4703	systems sounding as strange to him as the breathing of some
4704	half-awakened beast.
4705	Nine standard ship weeks later, Kassad stood before a FORCE
4706	court-martial review on Freeholm. He had known when he made his
4707	decision on Qom-Riyadh that his superiors would have no choice but to
4708	crucify or promote him.
4709	FORCE prided itself on preparing itself for all contingencies in the Web
4710	or the colonial regions, but nothing had properly prepared it for the
4711	Battle of South Bressia and its implications for the New Bushido.
4712	The New Bushido Code which governed Colonel Kassad's life had evolved
4713	out of the necessity for the military class to survive. After the
4714	obscenities of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries on
4715	Old Earth, when military leaders had committed their nations to
4716	strategies wherein entire civilian populations were legitimate targets
4717	while their uniformed executioners sat safe in self-contained bunkers
4718	fifty meters under the earth, the repugnance of the surviving civilians
4719	was so great that for more than a century the word 'military' was an
4720	invitation to a lynching.
4721	As the New Bushido evolved it combined the age-old concepts of honor and
4722	individual courage with the need to spare civilians whenever possible.
4723	It also saw the wisdom of returning to the pre-Napoleonic concepts of
4724	small, 'nontotal' wars with defined goals and proscribed excesses. The
4725	Code demanded a forsaking of nuclear weapons and strategic bombing
4726	campaigns in all but the most extreme cases but, more than that, it
4727	demanded a return to Old Earth medieval concepts of set battles between
4728	small, professional forces at a mutually agreed upon time in a place
4729	where destruction of public and private property would be kept to a
4730	minimum.
4731	This Code worked well for the first four centuries of post-Hegira
4732	expansion. The fact that essential technologies were essentially frozen
4733	in place for three of those centuries worked in the Hegemony's favor as
4734	its monopoly on the use of farcasters allowed it to apply the modest
4735	resources of FORCE at the right place in the required amount of time.
4736	Even when separated by the inevitable leap years of time-debt, no
4737	colonial or independent world could hope to match the power of the
4738	Hegemony. Incidents .such as the political rebellion on Maui-Covenant,
4739	with its unique guerrilla warfare, or the religious insanity on
4740	Qom-Riyadh were put down quickly and firmly and any excesses in the
4741	campaigns merely pointed out the importance of returning to the strict
4742	Code of the New Bushido. But for all of FORCE's calculations and
4743	preparations, no one had adequately planned on the inevitable
4744	confrontation with the Ousters.
4745	The Ousters had been the single external threat to the Hegemony for the
4746	four centuries since the forebears of the barbarian hordes had left Sol
4747	System in their crude fleet of leaking O'Neill cities, tumbling
4748	asteroids, and experimental comet farm clusters. Even after the Ousters
4749	acquired the Hawking drive, it remained official Hegemony policy to
4750	ignore them as long as their swarms stayed in the darkness between the
4751	stars and limited their in-system plunderings to scooping small amounts
4752	of hydrogen from gas giants and water ice from uninhabited moons.
4753	The early Outback skirmishes such as Bent's World and GHC 2990 were
4754	considered aberrations, of little interest to the Hegemony. Even the
4755	pitched battle for Lee Three had been treated as a Colonial Service
4756	problem and when the FORCE task force arrived six local years after the
4757	attack, five years after the Ousters departed, any atrocities were
4758	conveniently forgotten in favor of the view that no barbarian raid would
4759	repeat itself when the Hegemony chose to flex its muscle.
4760	In the decades which followed Lee Three, FORCE and Ouster space'forces
4761	skirmished in a hundred border
4762	areas, but except for the odd Marine encounters in airless, weightless
4763	places, there were no infantry confrontations.
4764	Stories in the Worldweb proliferated: the Ousters would never be a
4765	threat to Earthlike worlds because of their three centuries of
4766	adaptation to weight-lessness; the Ousters had evolved into something
4767	more -or less - than human; the Ousters did not have farcaster
4768	technology, would never have it, and thus never would.
4769	be a threat to FORCE. Then came Bressia.
4770	Bressia was one of those smug, independent worlds, pleased with both its
4771	convenient access to the Web and its eight-month separation from it,
4772	growing rich from the export of diamonds, burr root, and its unequaled
4773	coffee, coyly refusing to become a colony world but still dependent upon
4774	the Hegemony Protectorate and Common Market to meet its soaring economic
4775	goals. As with most such worlds, Bressia was proud of its Self-defense
4776	Force: twelve torchships, a refitted attack carrier which had been
4777	decommissioned by FORCE:space half a century earlier, twoscore or more
4778	of small, fast orbital patrol vessels, a standing army of ninety
4779	thousand volunteers, a respectable oceangoing navy, and a store of
4780	nuclear weapons stockpiled purely for symbolic purposes.
4781	The Ouster Hawking wake had been noticed by Hegemony monitoring stations
4782	but was misinterpreted as merely another swarm migration which would
4783	pass no closer than half a light-year to the Bressian system.
4784	Instead, with a single course correction which was not detected until
4785	the swarm was within the O6rt cloud radius, the Ousters fell on Bressia
4786	like some Old Testament plague. A minimum of seven standard months
4787	separated Bressia from any Hegemony rescue or response.
4788	Bressia's space force was obliterated within the first twenty hours of
4789	fighting. The Ouster swarm then put more than three thousand ships into
4790	Bressia's cislunar space and began the systematic reduction of all
4791	planetary defenses.
4792	The world had been settled by no-nonsense Central Europeans in the first
4793	wave of the Hegira, and its two continents bore the prosaic names of
4794	North Bressia and
4795	South Bressia. North Bressia held desert, high tundra, and six major
4796	cities housing mostly burr-root harvesters and petroleum engineers.
4797	South Bressia, much more temperate in climate and geography, was the
4798	home for most of the world's four hundred million people and the huge
4799	coffee plantations.
4800	As if to demonstrate what war had once been about, the Ousters scoured
4801	North Bressia - first with several hundred fallout-free nuclear weapons
4802	and tactical plasma bombs, then with deathbeams, and finally with
4803	tailored viruses. Only a handful of the fourteen million residents
4804	escaped. South Bressia received no bombardment except for the lancing
4805	of specific military targets, airports, and the large harbor at Solno.
4806	FORCE doctrine held that, while a world could be reduced from orbit,
4807	actual military invasion of an industrialized planet was an
4808	impossibility; the problems with landing logistics, the immense area to
4809	be occupied, and the unwieldy size of the invading army were considered
4810	to be the ultimate arguments against invasion.
4811	The Ousters obviously had not read the FORCE doctrine books. On the
4812	twenty-third day of the investiture, more than two thousand dropships
4813	and assault boats fell on South Bressia. What was left of the Bressian
4814	air force was destroyed in those first hours of the invasion. Two
4815	nuclear' devices were actually detonated against Ouster staging areas:
4816	the first was deflected by energy fields and the second destroyed a
4817	single scoutship which may have been a decoy.
4818	Ousters, it turned out, had changed physically in three centuries. They
4819	did prefer zero-gravity environments.
4820	But their mobile infantry's powered exoskeletons served very well and it
4821	was only, a matter of days before the black-clad, Iong-limbed Ouster
4822	troops were swarming over South Bressia's cities like an infestation of
4823	giant spiders.
4824	The last organized resistance collapsed on the nineteenth day of the
4825	invasion. Buckminster, the capital, fell the same day. The last
4826	fatline message from Bressia to the Hegemony was cut off in
4827	mid-transmission an hour after Ouster troops entered the city.
4828	Colonel Fedmahn Kassad arrived with FORCE Fleet One twenty-nine standard
4829	weeks later. Thirty omega-class torchships protecting a single,
4830	farcaster-equipped JumpShip penetrated the system at high speed. The
4831	singularity sphere was activated three hours after spin-down and ten
4832	hours after that there were four hundred FORCE ships of the line in
4833	system. The counterinvasion began twenty-one hours later.
4834	Those were the mathematics of the first minutes of the Battle of
4835	Bressia. For Kassad, the memory of those days and weeks held not
4836	mathematics but the terrible beauty of combat. It was the first time
4837	JumpShips had been used on anything above a division level and there was
4838	the expected confusion. Kassad went through from five light-minutes out
4839	and fell into gravel and yellow dust because. the assault boat
4840	farcaster portal was facing down a steep incline made slick with mud and
4841	the blood of the first squads through. Kassad lay in the mud and looked
4842	down the hillside at madness. Ten of the seventeen farcaster assault
4843	boats were down and burning, scattered across the foothills and
4844	plantation fields like broken toys. The containment fields of the
4845	surviving boats were shrinking under an onslaught of missile and CPB
4846	fire that turned the landing areas into domes of orange flame. Kassad's
4847	tactical display was a hopeless mess; his visor showed a garble of
4848	impossible fire vectors, blinking red phosphors where FORCE troops lay
4849	dying, and overlays of Ouster jamming ghosts. Someone was screaming
4850	'Oh, goddammit! Goddammit! Oh, goddammit!" on his primary command
4851	circuit and the implants registered a void where Command Group's data
4852	should be.
4853	An enlisted man helped him up, Kassad flicked mud off his command wand
4854	and got out of the way of the next squad farcasting through, and the war
4855	was on.
4856	From his first minutes on South Bressia, Kassad realized that the New
4857	Bushido was dead. Eighty thousand superbly armed and trained
4858	FORCE:ground troops advanced from their staging areas, seeking battle in
4859	an unpopulated place. Ouster forces retreated behind a line
4860	of scorched earth, leaving only booby traps and dead civilians. FORCE
4861	used farcasters to outmaneuver the enemy, to force him to fight. The
4862	Ousters responded with a barrage of nuclear and plasma weapons, pinning
4863	the ground troops under forcefields while the Ouster infantry retreated
4864	to prepared 'defenses around cities and dropship staging areas.
4865	There were no quick victories in space to shift the balance on South
4866	Bressia. Despite feints and occasional fierce battles, the Ousters
4867	retained complete control of everything within three AU of Bressia.
4868	FORCE:space units fell back and concentrated on keeping the fleet within
4869	farcaster range and protecting the primary JumpShip.
4870	What had been. forecast as a two-day battle ground on for thirty days,
4871	then sixty. Warfare had been thrown back to the twentieth or
4872	twenty-first century: long, grim campaigns fought through the brick dust
4873	of ruined cities over the corpses of civilians. The eighty thousand
4874	original FORCE troops were ground up, reinforced with a hundred thousand
4875	more, and were still being decimated when the call went out for two
4876	hundred thousand more.
4877	Only the grim resolve of Meina Gladstone and a dozen other determined
4878	senators kept the war alive and the troops dying while the billions of
4879	voices of the All Thing and the AI Advisory Council called for
4880	disengagement.
4881	Kassad had understood the change of tactics almost at once. His
4882	street-fighting instincts had risen to the forefront even before most of
4883	his division was wiped out in the Battle of the Stoneheap. While other
4884	FORCE commanders were all but ceasing to function, frozen into
4885	indecision by this violation of the New Bushido, Kassad - in command of
4886	his regiment and in temporary command of his division after the nuking
4887	of Command Group Delta - was trading men for time and calling for the
4888	release of fusion weapons to spearhead his own counterattack. By the
4889	time the Ousters withdrew ninety-seven days after the FORCE 'rescue' of
4890	Bressia, Kassad had earned the double-edged nickname of the Butcher of
4891	South Bressia. It was rumored that even his own troops were afraid of
4892	him.
4893	And Kassad dreamed of her with dreams that were more - and less - than
4894	dreams.
4895	On the last night of the Battle for Stoneheap, in the maze of dark
4896	tunnels where Kassad and his hunter-killer groups used sonics and T-5
4897	gas to flush out the last warrens of Ouster commandos, the Colonel fell
4898	asleep amid the flame and screams and felt the touch of her long fingers
4899	on his cheek and the soft compression of her breasts against him.
4900	When they entered New Vienna on the morning after the space strike
4901	Kassad had called in, the troops following the glass-smooth,
4902	twenty-meter-wide burn grooves into the lanced city, Kassad had stared
4903	without blinking at the rows of human heads lying on the pavement,
4904	carefully lined up as if to welcome the rescuing FORCE troops with their
4905	accusatory stares. Kassad had returned to his command EMV, closed the
4906	hatches, and - curling up in the warm darkness smelling of rubber,
4907	heated plastics, charged ions - had heard her whispers over the babble
4908	of the C3 channels and implant coding.
4909	On the night before the Ouster retreat, Kassad left the command
4910	conference on the HS Brazil, farcast to his HQ in the Indelibles north
4911	of the Hyne Valley, and took his command car to the summit to watch the
4912	final bombardment.
4913	The nearest of the tactical nuclear strikes was forty-five kilometers
4914	away. The plasma bombs blossomed like orange and blood-red flowers
4915	planted in a perfect grid.
4916	Kassad counted more than two hundred dancing columns of green light as
4917	the hellwhip lances ripped the broad plateau to shreds. And even before
4918	he slept, while he sat on the flare skirt of the EMV and shook pale
4919	afterimages from his eyes, she came. She wore a pale blue dress and
4920	walked lightly between the dead burr-root plants on the hillside.
4921	The breeze lifted the hem of the soft fabric of her dress. Her face and
4922	arms were pale, almost translucent. She called his name -
4923	hecouldalmosthearthewords - andthenthesec-ond wave of bombardment rolled
4924	in across the plain below him and everything was lost in noise and
4925	flame.
4926	As tends to be the case in a universe apparently ruled by irony, Fedmahn
4927	Kassad passed unscathed through ninety° seven days of the worst fighting
4928	the Hegemony had ever
4929	seen, only to be wounded two days after the last of the Ousters had
4930	retreated to their fleeing swarmships. He was in the Civic Center
4931	Building in Buckminster, one of only three buildings left standing in
4932	the city, giving curt answers to stupid questions from a Worldweb
4933	newsteep when a plasma booby trap no larger than a microswitch exploded
4934	fifteen floors above, blew the newsteep and two of Kassad's aides
4935	through a ventilator grille into the street beyond, and dropped the
4936	building on him.
4937	Kassad was medevacked to division HQ and then far-cast to the JumpShip
4938	now in orbit around Bressia's second moon. There he was resuscitated
4939	and put on full life support while the military brass and Hegemony
4940	politicians decided what to do with him.
4941	Because of the farcaster connection and the real-time media coverage of
4942	Bressia, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad had become somewhat of a cause cdibre.
4943	Those billions who had been appalled by the unprecedented savagery of
4944	the South Bressia campaign would have been pleased to see Kassad
4945	court-martialed or tried for war crimes. CEO Gladstone and many others
4946	considered Kassad and the other FORCE commanders as saviors.
4947	In the end, Kassad was put on a hospital spinship for the slow trip back
4948	to the Web. Since most of the physical repair would be done in fugue
4949	anyway, it made some sense to let the old hospital ships work on the
4950	seriously wounded and the revivable dead. By the time Kassad and
4951	' the other patients reached the Worldweb, they would be ready for
4952	active duty. More importantly, Kassad would have accrued a time-debt of
4953	at least eighteen standard months and whatever controversy surrounded
4954	him might well be over by that time.
4955	Kassad awoke to see the dark shape of a woman bending over him. For a
4956	second he was sure that it was her, and
4957	then he realized that it was aFORCE medic.
4958	'Am I dead?" he whispered.
4959	'You were. You're on the HS Merrick. You've been through resuscitation
4960	and renewal several times but you probably don't. remember because of
4961	the fugue hangover.
4962	We're ready to start the next step in physical
4963	therapy. Do you feel like trying to walk?"
4964	Kassad lifted his arm to cover his eyes. Even through the
4965	disorientation of fugue state, he now remembered the painful therapy
4966	sessions, the long hours in the RNA virus baths, and the surgery. Most
4967	of all the surgery.
4968	'What's our route?" he asked, still shielding his eyes. 'I forget how
4969	we're getting back to the Web."
4970	The medic smiled as if this were a question he asked each time he came
4971	out of fugue. Perhaps it was. 'We'll be putting in at Hyperion and
4972	Garden,' she said. 'We're just entering the orbit of..."
4973	The woman was interrupted by the sound of the end of the world - great
4974	brass trumpets blowing, metal ripping, furies screaming. Kassad rolled
4975	off the bed, wrapping the mattress around him as he fell in the
4976	one-sixth g.
4977	Hurricane winds slid him across the deck and hurled pitchers, trays,
4978	bedclothes, books, bodies, metal instruments, and countless other
4979	objects at him. Men and women were screaming, their voices rising
4980	through falsetto as the air rushed out of the ward. Kassad felt the
4981	mattress slam into the wall; he looked out between clenched fists.
4982	A meter from him, a football-sized spider with wildly waving legs was
4983	trying to force itself into a crack which had suddenly appeared in the
4984	bulkhead. The thing's jointless legs seemed to be swatting at the paper
4985	and other detritus whirling around it. The spider rotated and Kassad
4986	realized that it was the head of the medic; she had been decapitated in
4987	the initial explosion. Her long hair writhed at Kassad's face. Then
4988	the crack widened to the width of a fist and the head disappeared
4989	through it.
4990	Kassad pulled himself up just as the boom arm quit spinning and 'up'
4991	ceased to be. The only forces now in play were the hurricane winds
4992	still flinging everything in the ward toward the cracks and gaps in the
4993	bulkhead and the sickening lurch and tumble of the ship. Kassad swam
4994	against it all, pulling himself toward the door to the boom-arm
4995	corridor, using every handhold he could find, kicking free the last five
4996	meters. A metal tray struck him above the eye; a corpse with
4997	hemorrhaged eyes almost tumbled him back into the ward. The airtight
4998	emergency
4999	doors were slamming uselessly into a dead Marine whose spacesuited body
5000	blocked the seal from closing. Kassad rolled through into the boom-arm
5001	shaft and pulled the corpse after him. The door sealed behind him, but
5002	there was no more air in the shaft than there had been in the ward.
5003	Somewhere a klaxon's scream thinned to inaudibility.
5004	Kassad also screamed, trying to relieve the pressure so that his lungs
5005	and eardrums would not burst. The boom arm was still draining air; he
5006	and the corpse were being sucked the hundred and thirty meters to the
5007	main body of the ship. He and the dead Marine tumbled along the
5008	boom-arm shaft in a grisly waltz.
5009	It took Kassad twenty seconds to slap open the emergency releases on the
5010	Marine's suit, another minute to eject the man's corpse and to get his
5011	own body in. He was at least ten centimeters taller than the dead man,
5012	and although the suit was built to allow some expansion, it still
5013	pinched painfully at his neck and wrists and knees.
5014	The helmet squeezed his forehead like a cushioned vise.
5015	Gobbets of blood and a moist white material clung to tbe inside of the
5016	visor. The piece of shrapnel which had killed the Marine had left
5017	entrance and exit holes, but tbe suit had done its best to seal itself.
5018	Most of the chest lights were red and the suit did not respond when
5019	Kassad ordered it to give a status report, but the rebreather worked,
5020	although with a worrying rasp.
5021	Kassad tried the suit radio. Nothing, not even background static. He
5022	found the comlog lead, jacked into a hull termex. Nothing. The ship
5023	pitched again then, metal reverberating to a succession of blows, and
5024	Kassad was thrown against the wall of the boom-arm shaft. One of the
5025	transport cages tumbled by, its severed cables whipping like the
5026	tentacles of an agitated sea anemone. There were corpses in the cage
5027	and more bodies tangled along the segments of spiral staircase still
5028	intac along the shaft wall. Kassad kicked the remaining distance to the
5029	end of the shaft and found all of the airtight doors there sealed, the
5030	boom-arm shaft itself irised shut, but there were holes in the primary
5031	bulkhead large enough to drive a commercial EMV through.
5032	The ship lurched again and began to tumble more wildly, imparting
5033	complex new Coriolis forces to Kassad and everything else in the shaft.
5034	Kassad hung on torn metal and pulled himself through a rent in the
5035	triple hull of the HS Merrick.
5036	He almost laughed when he saw the interior. Whoever had lanced the old
5037	hospital ship had done it right, chopping and stabbing the hull with
5038	CPBs until pressure seals failed, self-seal units ruptured,
5039	damage-control remotes overloaded, and the interior bulkheads collapsed.
5040	Then the enemy ship had put missiles into the guts of the hulk with
5041	warheads o f what the FORCE:space people quaintly called canister shot.
5042	The effect had been quite similar to setting off an antipersonnel
5043	grenade in a crowded rat maze.
5044	Lights shone through a thousand holes, here and there becoming colorful
5045	rays where they found a colloidal base in floating haze of dust or blood
5046	or lubricant. From where Kassad hung, twisting with the lurch and
5047	tumble of the ship, he could see a score or more of bodies, naked and
5048	torn, each moving with the deceptive underwater-ballet grace of the
5049	zero-gravity dead. Most of the corpses floated within their own small
5050	solar systems of blood and tissue. Several of them watched Kassad with
5051	the cartoon-character sares of their pressure-expanded eyes and seemed
5052	to beckon him closer with random, languid movements of arms and hands.
5053	Kassad kicked through the wreckage to reach the main dropshaft to the
5054	command core. He had seen no weapons - it seemed that no one except the
5055	Marine had managed to suit up - but he knew that there would be a
5056	weapons locker in the command core or in the Marine quarters aft.
5057	Kassad stopped at the last torn pressure seal and stared. He did laugh
5058	this time. Beyond this point there was no main dropshaft, no aft
5059	section. There was no ship. This section - a boom-arm and medical ward
5060	mod, a ragged chunk of the hull - had been ripped free of the ship as
5061	easily as Beowulf had torn the arm from Grendel's body. The final,
5062	unsealed doorway to the dropshaft led to open space. Some kilometers
5063	away,
5064	Kassad could see a dozen other ravaged fragments of the HS Merrick
5065	tumbling in the glare of sunlight. A green and lapis planet loomed so
5066	close that Kassad felt a surge of acrophobia and clung more tightly to
5067	the doorframe.
5068	Even as he watched, a star moved above the limb of the planet, laser
5069	weapons winked their ruby morse, and a gutted ship section half a
5070	kilometer away across the gulf of vacuum from Kassad burst again in a
5071	gout of vaporized metal, freezing volatiles, and tumbling black specks
5072	which Kassad realized were bodies.
5073	Kassad pulled himself deeper into the concealing tangle of wreckage and
5074	considered his situation. The Marine's suit could not last more than
5075	another hour -already Kassad could smell the rotten-eggs stench of the
5076	malfunctioning rebreather - and he had seen no airtight compartment or
5077	container during his struggle through the wreckage. And even if he
5078	found a closet or air-lock to shelter in, what then? Kassad did not
5079	know if the planet below was Hyperion or Garden, but he was sure that
5080	there was no FORCE presence on either world. He was also quite sure
5081	that no local defense forces would challenge an Ouster warship. It
5082	would be days before any patrol craft investigated the wreckage. It was
5083	quite possible, Kassad knew, that the orbit of the tumbling piece of
5084	junk he now inhabited would decay before they sent anyone up to check on
5085	it, sending thousands of tons of twisted metal burning through the
5086	atmosphere.
5087	The locals would not like that, Kassad knew, but from their point of
5088	view it might be preferable to let a bit of sky fall than to antagonize
5089	the Ousters. If the planet had primitive orbital defenses or
5090	ground-based CPBs, he realized with a grim smile, it would make more
5091	sense for them to blast the wreckage than to fire on the Ouster ship.
5092	It would make no difference to Kassad. Unless he did something quickly,
5093	he would be dead long before the remnants of the ship entered atmosphere
5094	or the locals took action.
5095	The Marine's amplification shield had been cracked by the shrapnel which
5096	had killed him, but now Kassad tugged what was left of the viewplate
5097	down over the
5098	visor. Telltales winked red but there was still enough suit power to
5099	show the amplified view glowing pale green through the spiderweb of
5100	cracks. Kassad watched as the Ouster torchship stood off a hundred
5101	klicks, its defense fields blurring background stars, and launched
5102	several objects. For an instant Kassad was sure that these were the
5103	coup de grdce missiles and he found himself grinning joylessly at the
5104	certainty of having only a few seconds to live. Then he noticed their
5105	low velocity and notched the amplification higher. The power lights
5106	blinked red and the amplifier failed, but not before Kassad had seen the
5107	tapering ovoid shapes, spotted with thrusters and cockpit blisters, each
5108	trailing a tangle of six jointless manipulator arms. 'Squids,' the
5109	FORCE:space people had called the Ouster boarding craft.
5110	Kassad pulled himself farther back in the wreckage.
5111	He had only a few minutes before one or more of the squids reached his
5112	piece of the ship. How many Ousters would one of those things carry?
5113	Ten? Twenty? Kassad was sure that it would be no fewer than ten. And
5114	they would be well armed and rigged with infrared and motion sensors.
5115	The elite Ouster equivalent of Hegemony Space Marines, the commandos
5116	would not only have been trained for free-fall combat but had been born
5117	and bred to zero-g. Their long limbs, prehensile toes, and prosthetic
5118	tails would be added advantages for this environment, although Kassad
5119	doubted that they needed any more advantages than they already had.
5120	He began to pull himself carefully back through the labyrinth of twisted
5121	metal, fighting the adrenaline fear-surge that made him want to kick off
5122	screaming through the darkness. What did they want? Prisoners. That
5123	would solve his immediate survival problem. All he had to do to survive
5124	was surrender. The difficulty with that solution' was that Kassad had
5125	seen the FORCE:intelligence holos of the Ouster ship they had captured
5126	off Bressia. There had been more than two hundred prisoners in the
5127	storage bay of that ship. And the Ousters obviously had many questions
5128	for these Hegemony citizens.
5129	Perhaps they had found it inconvenient to feed and imprison so many- or
5130	perhaps it was their basic
5131	interrogation policy - but the fact was that the Bressian civilians and
5132	captured FORCE troops had been found flayed open and pinned down on
5133	steel trays like frogs in a biology lab, their organs bathed with
5134	nutrient fluids, arms and legs efficiently amputated, eyes removed, and
5135	their minds readied for interrogators' questions with crude cortical
5136	comtaps and shunt-plugs jacked directly through three-centimeter holes
5137	in the skulls.
5138	Kassad pulled himself along, floating through debris and the tangled
5139	entrails of the ship's wiring. He felt no inclination whatsoever to
5140	surrender. The tumbling hulk vibrated and then steadied some as at
5141	least one of the squids attached itself to the hull or bulkhead. Think,
5142	Kassad commanded. He needed a weapon more than a hiding place. Had he
5143	seen anything during his crawl through the wreckage that would help him
5144	survive?
5145	Kassad stopped moving and hung from an exposed section of fiberoptic
5146	cable while he thought. The medical ward where he had awakened, beds,
5147	fugue tanks, intensive care apparatus... most of it expelled through
5148	the breaches in the spinmod's hull. Boom-arm shaft, elevator cage,
5149	corpses on the stairs. No weapons. Most of the bodies had been
5150	stripped by the canister shot explosions or sudden decompression. The
5151	elevator cables? No, too long, impossible to sever without tools.
5152	Tools? He had seen none. The medical offices fiayed open along the
5153	corridors beyond the main dropshaft. Medical imaging rooms, MRI tanks,
5154	and CPD bays flung open like looted sarcophagi. At least one operating
5155	room intact, its interior a maze of scattered instruments and floating
5156	cables.
5157	The solarium, scraped clean when the windows exploded outward. Patient
5158	lounges. Medics' lounges. The scrub rooms, corridors, and
5159	unidentifiable cubicles. The corpses.
5160	Kassad hung there a second longer, oriented himself in tbe tumbling maze
5161	of light and shadow, and then kicked off.
5162	He had hoped for ten minutes; he was given less than eight. He knew
5163	that the Ousters would be methodical and efficient but had
5164	underestimated how efficient they could be in zero-g. He gambled his
5165	life that there would
5166	be at least two of them on each sweep - basic Space Marine procedure,
5167	much as FORCE:ground jump rats had learned to go door to door il city
5168	fighting, one to burst into each room, the other to provide cover fire.
5169	If there were more than two, if the Ousters worked in squads of four,
5170	Kassad almost certainly would be dead.
5171	He was floating in the middle of Operating Room 3 when the Ouster came
5172	through the door. Kassad's febfeather had all but failed, he was
5173	floating immobile, gasping foul air, as the Ouster commando swung in,
5174	swung aside, and brought his two weapons to bear on the unarmed figure
5175	in a battered Marine spacesuit.
5176	Kassad had bargained that the gruesome condition of his suit and visor
5177	would gain him a second or two.
5178	Behind his gore-smeared faceplate, Kassad's eyes stared sightlessly
5179	upward as the Ouster's chestlight swept across him. The commando
5180	carried two weapons- a sonic stunner in one hand and a smaller but much
5181	more lethal tightbeam pistol in the long toes of his left 'foot." He
5182	raised the sonic. Kassad had time to notice the killing spike on the
5183	prosthetic tail and then he triggered the mouse in his gauntleted right
5184	hand.
5185	It had taken Kassad most of his eight minutes to tie in the emergency
5186	generator to the operating-room circuits.
5187	Not all of the surgery lasers had survived, but six still worked. Kassad
5188	had positioned four of the smaller ones to cover the area just to the
5189	left of the doorway, the two bone-cutters to target the space to the
5190	right. The Ouster had moved to the right.
5191	The Ouster's suit exploded. The lasers continued to slice away in their
5192	preprogrammed circles as Kassad propelled himself forward, ducking under
5193	the blue beams now swirling in a spreading mist of useless suit sealant
5194	and boiling blood. He wrested the sonic away just as the second Ouster
5195	swung into the room, agile as an Old Earth chimp.
5196	Kassad pressed the sonic against the man's helmet and fired. The suited
5197	figure went !imp. The prosthetic tail spasmed a few times from random
5198	nerve impulses. Triggering the sonic that close was no way to take a
5199	prisoner; a burst from that distance turned a human brain into
5200	something resembling oatmeal mush. Kassad did not want to take a
5201	prisoner.
5202	He kicked free,. grabbed a girder, swept the active sonic across the
5203	open doorway. No one else came through. A check twenty seconds later
5204	showed an empty corridor.
5205	Kassad ignored the first body and stripped the man with the intact suit.
5206	The commando was naked under the spacesuit and it turned out not to be a
5207	man; the female commando had short-cropped blond hair, small breasts,
5208	and a tattoo just above her line of pubic hair. She was very pale and
5209	droplets of blood floated from her nose, ears, and eyes. Kassad made a
5210	note that the Ousters used women in their Marines. All of the Ouster
5211	bodies on Bressia had been male.
5212	He kept his helmet and rebreather pack on as he kicked the body aside
5213	and tugged on the unfamiliar suit.
5214	Vacuum exploded blood vessels in his flesh. Deep cold nipped at him as
5215	he struggled with strange clasps and locks. Tall as he was, he was too
5216	short for the woman's suit. He could operate the hand gauntlets by
5217	stretching, but the foot gloves and tail connections were hopeless.
5218	Hc let them hang useless as he bailed out of his own helmet and wrestled
5219	the Ouster bubble into place.
5220	Lights in the collar diskey glowed amber and violet.
5221	Kassad heard the rush of air through aching eardrums and almost gagged
5222	as a thick, rich stench assailed him.
5223	He assumed it was the sweet smell of home to an Ouster.
5224	Earphone patches in the bubble whispered coded commands in a language
5225	which sounded like an audio tape of Ancient English played backward at
5226	high speed.
5227	Kassad was gambling again, this time on the fact that Ouster ground
5228	units on Bressia had functioned as semi-independent teams united by
5229	voice radio and basic telemetry rather than a FORCE:ground type of
5230	tactical implant web. If they used the same system here, then the
5231	commando leader might know that two of his (or her) troops were missing,
5232	possibly even have medcom readings on them, but might not know exactly
5233	where they were.
5234	Kassad decided that it was time to quit hypothesizing
5235	and to get moving. He programmed the mouse to have the surgical lasers
5236	fire on anything entering the operating room, and then bounce-stumbled
5237	his way down the corridor.
5238	Moving in one of these damn suits, he thought, was like trying to walk
5239	in a gravity field while standing on your own trousers. He had brought
5240	along both energy pistols and - finding no belt, lockrings, hooks,
5241	Velcro pads, macclamps, or pockets to secure them with - now floated
5242	along like some drunken holodrama pirate, a weapon in each hand,
5243	bouncing from wall to wall. Reluc-tanfly, he left one pistol floating
5244	behind him while he tried to hook himself along one-handed. The
5245	gauntlet fit like a size fifteen mitten on a size two hand. The damned
5246	tail wobbled, banged against his helmet bubble, and was a literal pain
5247	in the ass.
5248	Twice he squeezed into crevices when he saw lights in the distance. He
5249	was just about to the deck opening where he had watched the squid
5250	approach when he rounded a corner and almost floated into three Ouster
5251	commandos.
5252	The fact that he was wearing an Ouster suit gave him at least a
5253	two-second advantage. He shot the first suited figure in the helmet at
5254	point-blank range. The second man- or woman- fired a wild sonic burst
5255	past Kassad's left shoulder a second before he put three bolts into the
5256	Ouster's chestplate. The third commando flipped backward, found three
5257	handholds, and was out of sight around a broken bulkhead before Kassad
5258	could retarget. His headset rang with curses, commands, and questions.
5259	Kassad gave silent chase.
5260	The third Ouster would have escaped if he had not rediscovered honor and
5261	turned to fight. Kassad felt an inexplicable sense of djt vu as he put
5262	an energy bolt through the man's left eye from five meters away.
5263	The corpse tumbled backward into sunlight. Kassad pulled himself to the
5264	opening and stared at the squid moored not twenty meters'away. It was,
5265	he thought, the first undiluted piece of luck he had had in some time.
5266	He kicked across the gap, knowing that if someone wanted to shoot him
5267	from the squid or the wreckage there was nothing he could do about it.
5268	He felt the
5269	scrotum-lifting tension he always experienced when he was an obvious
5270	target. No shots were fired. Commands and interrogatives squawked in
5271	his ears. He could not understand them, did not know where they
5272	originated, and, on the whole, thought it best if he stayed out of the
5273	dialogue.
5274	The clumsiness of the suit almost caused him to miss the squid. He
5275	thought briefly that such an anticlimax would be the universe's fitting
5276	verdict on his martial pretensions: the brave warrior floating off into
5277	near-planet orbit, no maneuvering systems, no propellant, no reaction
5278	mass of any sort - even the pistol was non-recoil.
5279	He would end his life as useless and harmless as a child's runaway
5280	balloon.
5281	Kassad stretched until his joints popped, caught a whip antenna, and
5282	pulled himself hand over handto the squid's hull.
5283	Where the hell was the airlock? The hull was relatively smooth for a
5284	spacefaring vessel but was decorated with a riot of designs, decals, and
5285	panels announcing what he assumed were the Ouster equivalents of NO STEP
5286	and DANGER: THRUSTER PORT. No entrances were visible. He guessed that
5287	there were Ousters on board, a pilot at least, and that they were
5288	probably wondering why their returning commando was crawling around the
5289	hull like a spavined crab rather than cycling the airlock. Or perhaps
5290	they knew why and were waiting inside with drawn pistols.
5291	At any rate, it was obvious that no one was going to open the door for
5292	him.
5293	The hell with it, thought Kassad and shot out one of 'the observation
5294	blisters.
5295	The Ousters kept a tidy ship. Not much more than the equivalent of a
5296	few lost paper clips and coins geysered out with the ship's air. Kassad
5297	waited until the eruption had died down and squeezed through the gap.
5298	He was in the carrier section: a cushioned hold looking a lot like the
5299	jump rat bay of any dropship or APC.
5300	Kassad made a mental note that a squid probably held about twenty Ouster
5301	commandos in full vacuum combat gear. Now it was empty. An open hatch
5302	led to the cockpit.
5303	Only the command pilot had remained on board and he was in the final
5304	process of unbelting when Kassad shot him. Kassad pushed the body into
5305	the carrier section and strapped himself into what he hoped was the
5306	command chair.
5307	Warm sunlight came through the blister above him.
5308	Video monitors and console hoios showed scenes from dead ahead, astern,
5309	and shoulder-camera glimpses of the search operation inside. Kassad
5310	caught a glimpse of the nude body in Operating Room 3 and several
5311	figures in a firefight with surgical lasers.
5312	In the holodramas of Fedmahn Kassad's childhood, heroes always seemed to
5313	know how to operate skimmers, spacecraft, exotic EMVs, and other strange
5314	machinery whenever the need arose. Kassad had been trained to handle
5315	military transports, simple tanks and APCs, even an assault boat or
5316	dropship if he was desperate. If stranded on a runaway FORCE
5317	spacecraft, a remote possibility, he could find his way around the
5318	command core sufficiently to communicate with the primary computer or
5319	put out a distress call on a radio or fatline transmitter.
5320	Sitting in the command chair of an Ouster squid, Kassad did not have a
5321	clue.
5322	That was not quite true. He immediately recognized the remote grip
5323	slots for the squid's tentacle manipulators, and given two or three
5324	hours of thought and inspection, he might have figured out several other
5325	controls. He did not have the time. The forward screen showed three
5326	spacesuited figures jumping for the squid, firing as they came. The
5327	pale, oddly alien head of an Ouster commander suddenly materialized on
5328	the holo console. Kassad heard shouts from his bubble earpatches.
5329	Globules of sweat hung in front of his eyes and streaked the inside of
5330	his helmet. He shook them away as best he could, squinted at the
5331	control consoles, and pushed several likely-looking surfaces. If there
5332	were voice command circuits, override controls, or a suspicious ship's
5333	computer, Kassad knew, he was screwed. He had thought of all this in
5334	the second or two before he shot the pilot but had not been able to
5335	think of a way to coerce
5336	or trust the man. No, this had to be the way, thought
5337	Kassad even as he tapped more control surfaces.
5338	A thruster began firing.
5339	The squid pulled and tugged at its moorings. Kassad bounced back and
5340	forth in his webbing. 'Shit,' he whispered, his first audible comment
5341	since he had asked the FORCE medic where the ship was putting in. He
5342	strained far enough forward to get his gauntleted fingers into the grip
5343	slots. Four of the six manipulators released. One ripped off. The
5344	final one tore away a chunk of bulkhead from the HS Merrick.
5345	The squid tumbled free. Video cameras showed two of the space-suited
5346	figures missing their jumps, the third clutching at the same whip
5347	antenna which had saved Kassad. Knowing roughly where the thruster
5348	controls were'now, Kassad tapped in a frenzy. An overhead light came
5349	on. All of the holo projectors went dead. The squid commenced a
5350	maneuver which incorporated all of the most violent elements of pitch,
5351	roll, and yaw. Kassad saw the spacesuited form tumble past the overhead
5352	blister, appear briefly on the forward video screen, become a speck on
5353	the aft screen. The Ouster was still firing energy bolts as he - or she
5354	- became too small to see.
5355	Kassad struggled to stay conscious as the violent tumbling continued.
5356	Various voice and visual alarms were screaming for his attention. Kassad
5357	tapped at thruster controls, considered it a success, and pulled his
5358	hands away when he felt as if he were being pulled apart in only two
5359	directions rather than five.
5360	A random camera shot showed him that the torchship was receding. Good.
5361	Kassad had no doubt that the Ouster warship could destroy him at any
5362	second, and that it would if he approached or threatened it in any way.
5363	He did not know if the squid was armed, personally doubted if it would
5364	carry anything larger than antipersonnel weapons, but he knew beyond a
5365	doubt that no torchship commander would allow an out-of-control
5366	shuttlecraft to come anywhere near his ship.
5367	Kassad assumed that the Ousters all knew by now that the squid had been
5368	hijacked by the enemy. He would not be surprised - disappointed, but
5369	not surprised - if the
5370	torchship vaporized him at any second, but in the meantime he was
5371	counting on two emotions that were quint-essentially human if not
5372	necessarily Ouster human: curiosity and the desire for revenge.
5373	Curiosity, he knew, could easily be overridden in times of stress, but
5374	he counted on a paramilitary, semifeudal culture like the Ousters' to be
5375	deeply involved with revenge. Everything else being equal, with no
5376	chance to hurt them further and almost no chance to escape, it would
5377	seem that Colonel Fedmahn Kassad had become a prime candidate for one of
5378	their dissection trays. He hoped so.
5379	Kassad looked at the forward video display, frowned, and loosened his
5380	harness long enough to look out the overhead blister. The ship was
5381	tumbling but not nearly so violently as before. The planet seemed
5382	closer - one hemisphere filled the view 'above' him - but he had no idea
5383	how close the squid Was to atmosphere. He could read none of the data
5384	displays. He could only guess what their orbital velocity had been and
5385	how violent a reentry shock would be. His one long glimpse from the
5386	wreckage of the Merrick had suggested to Kassad that they were very
5387	close, perhaps only five or six hundred klicks above the surface, and in
5388	the kind of parking orbit which he knew preceded the launching of
5389	dropships.
5390	Kassad tried to wipe his face and frowned when the tips of loose
5391	gauntlet fingers tapped at his visor. He was tired. Hell, only a few
5392	hours earlier he had been in fugue and just a few ship-weeks before that
5393	he had almost certainly been body-dead.
5394	He wondered if the world below was Hyperion or Garden; he had been to
5395	neither but knew that Garden was more widely settled, closer to becoming
5396	a Hegemony colony. He hoped it was Garden.
5397	The torchship launched three assault boats. Kassad saw them clearly
5398	before the aft camera panned beyond range. He tapped at the thruster
5399	controls until it felt as though the ship was tumbling more quickly
5400	toward the wall of planet above. There was little else he could do.
5401	The squid reached atmosphere before the three Ouster assault boats
5402	reached the squid. The boats undoubtedly were armed and well within
5403	range, but someone on the command circuit must have been curious. Or
5404	furious.
5405	Kassad's squid was in no way aerodynamic. As with most ship-to-ship
5406	craft, the squid could flirt with planetary atmospheres but was doomed
5407	if it dove too deeply into the gravity well. Kassad saw the telltale
5408	red glow of reentry, heard the ion buildup on the active radio channels,
5409	and suddenly wondered if this had been such a good idea.
5410	Atmospheric drag stabilized the squid and Kassad felt the first
5411	tentative tug of gravity as he searched the console and the command
5412	chair arms for the control circuit he prayed would be there. A
5413	static-filled video screen showed one of the dropships growing a
5414	blue-plasma tall as it decelerated. The illusion created was similar to
5415	that encountered when one skydiver watched another open his chute or
5416	activate his suspension rig; the assault boat seemed to climb suddenly.
5417	Kassad had other things to worry about. There seemed to be no obvious
5418	bail-out control, no ejection apparatus.
5419	Every FORCE:space shuttle carried some sort of atmospheric egress
5420	device- it was a custom dating back almost eight centuries to when the
5421	entire realm of space flight consisted only of tentative excursions just
5422	above the skin of Old Earth's atmosphere. A ship-to-ship shuttle
5423	probably would never need a planetary bail-out device, but age-old fears
5424	written into ancient regulations tended 'to die hard.
5425	Or so the theory went. Kassad could find nothing. The ship was quaking
5426	now, spinning, and beginning to heat up in earnest. Kassad slapped open
5427	his harness release and pulled himself toward the rear of the squid, not
5428	even sure what he was looking for. Suspension packs? Parachutes?
5429	A set of wings?
5430	There was nothing in the troop carrier section except the corpse of the
5431	Ouster pilot and a few storage compartments not much larger than
5432	lunchboxes. Kassad tore through them, finding nothing bigger than a
5433	medkit. No miracle devices.
5434	Kassad could hear the squid shaking and beginning to break up as he hung
5435	on a pivot ring and all but accepted the fact that the Ousters had not
5436	wasted money or space on such low-probability rescue devices for their
5437	squids.
5438	Why should they? Their lifetimes were spent in the dark-nesses between
5439	star systems; their concept of an atmosphere was the eight-klick
5440	pressurized tube of a can city.
5441	The external audio sensors on Kassad's bubble helmet began to pick up
5442	the raging hiss of air on the hull and through the broken blister in the
5443	aft section. Kassad shrugged. He had gambled too many times and lost.
5444	The squid shuddered and bounced. Kassad could hear the manipulator
5445	tentacles tearing away from the bow.
5446	The Ouster's corpse suddenly was sucked up and out of the broken blister
5447	like an ant into a vacuum cleaner.
5448	Kassad clung to the pivot ring and stared through the open hatch at the
5449	control seats in the cockpit. It struck him that they were wonderfully
5450	archaic, like something out of a textbook of the earliest spacecraft.
5451	Parts of the ship's exterior were burning away now, roaring past the
5452	observation blisters like gobbets of lava. Kassad closed his eyes and
5453	tried to remember lectures from Olympus Command School on the structure
5454	and layout of ancient spacegoing craft. The squid began a terminal
5455	tumble.
5456	The noise was incredible.
5457	'By Allah!" gasped Kassad, a cry he had not uttered since childhood. He
5458	began pulling himself forward into the cockpit, bracing himself on the
5459	open hatch, finding handholds on the deck as if he were climbing a
5460	vertical wall. He was climbing a wall. The squid had spun, stabilized
5461	in a stern-first death dive. Kassad climbed under a 3-g load, knowing
5462	that a single slip would break every bone in his body. Behind 'him,
5463	atmospheric hiss turned to a scream and then to a dragon roar. The
5464	troop carrier section was burning through in fierce, molten explosions.
5465	Climbing into the command seat was like negotiating a rock overhang with
5466	the weight of two other climbers swinging from his back. The clumsy
5467	gauntlets made his grip on the headrest even less sure as Kassad hung
5468	over the vertical drop to the flaming cauldron of the carrier
5469	section. The ship lurched, Kassad swung his legs up, and he was in the
5470	command seat. The display videos were dead. Flame heated the overhead
5471	blister to a sick red.
5472	Kassad almost lost consciousness as he bent forward, his fingers feeling
5473	in the darkness below the command seat, between his knees. There was
5474	nothing. Wait... a hand-grip.
5475	No, sweet Christ and Allah . . . a D-ring. Something out of the
5476	history books.
5477	The squid began o break up. Overhead, the blister burned through and
5478	spattered liquid Perspex throughout the interior of the cockpit,
5479	splashing Kassad's suit and visor. He smelled plastic melting· The
5480	squid was spinning as it broke up. Kassad's sight turned pink, dimmed,
5481	was gone. He used numb fingers to tighten the harness · . . tighter...
5482	either it was cutting into his chest or the Perspex had burned through.
5483	His hand went back to the D-ring. Fingers too clumsy to close around
5484	it... no.
5485	Pull.
5486	Too late. The squid flew apart in a final screech and explosion of
5487	flame, the control console tearing through the cockpit in ten thousand
5488	shrapnel-sized bits.
5489	Kassad was slammed into his seat. Up. Out. Into the
5490	heart of the flame.
5491	Tumbling·
5492	Kassad was dimly aware that the seat was projecting its own containment
5493	field as it tumbled. Flame was centimeters from his face.
5494	Pyrobolts fired, kicking the ejection seat out of the squid's blazing
5495	slipstream. The command seat made its own track of blue flame across
5496	the sky. Microprocessors spun the seat so that the disc of the
5497	forcefield was between Kassad and the furnace of friction. A giant sat
5498	on Kassad's chest as he decelerated across two thousand kilometers of
5499	sky at eight gravities.
5500	Kassad forced his eyelids open once, noted that he lay curled in the
5501	belly of a long column of blue-white flame, and then he closed his eyes
5502	again. He saw no sign of a control for a parachute, suspension pack, or
5503	any other braking device· It didn't matter· He could not move his arms
5504	or hands in any case.
5505	The giant shifted, grew heavier·
5506	Kassad realized that part of his helmet bubble had melted or been blown
5507	away. The noise was indescribable.
5508	It didn't matter.
5509	He closed his eyes more tightly. It was a good time to take a nap.
5510	Kassad opened his eyes and saw the dark shape of a woman bending over
5511	him. For a second he thought it was her. He looked again and realized
5512	that it was her. She touched his cheek with cool fingers.
5513	'Am I dead?" whispered Kassad, raising his own hand to grip her wrist.
5514	'No." Her voice was soft and throaty, burred with the hint of an accent
5515	he could not place. He had never heard
5516	her speak before.
5517	'You're real?" 'Yes."
5518	Kassad sighed and looked around. He lay naked under a thin robe on some
5519	sort of couch or platform set in the middle of a dark, cavernous room.
5520	Overhead, starlight was visible through a broken roof. Kassad raised
5521	his other hand to touch her shoulder. Her hair was a dark nimbus above
5522	him. She wore a loose, thin gown which -even in the starlight - allowed
5523	him to see the outlines of her body. He caught her scent, the fragrant
5524	hint of soap and skin and her that he knew so well from their other
5525	times together.
5526	'You must have questions,' she whispered as Kassad released the gold
5527	clasp which held her gown in place. The gown whispered to the floor.
5528	She wore nothing underneath.
5529	Above them, the band of the Milky Way was clearly visible·
5530	'No,' said Kassad and pulled her to him.
5531	Toward morning a breeze arose, and Kassad pulled the light cover over
5532	them. The thin material seemed to preserve all of their body heat and
5533	they lay together in perfect warmth. Somewhere sand or snow rasped at
5534	bare walls. The stars were very clear and very bright.
5535	They awoke at the first hint of dawn, their faces close
5536	together under the silken coverlet. She ran her hand
5537	down Kassad's side, finding old and recent scars.
5538	'Your name?" whispered Kassad.
5539	'Hush,' she whispered back, her hand sliding lower.
5540	Kassad moved his face into the scented curve of her neck. Her breasts
5541	were soft against him. Night paled to morning. Somewhere sand or snow
5542	blew against bare walls.
5543	They made love, slept, made love again. In full light they rose and
5544	dressed. She had laid out underwear, gray tunic and trousers for
5545	Kassad. They fit perfectly, as did the spongesocks and soft hoots. The
5546	woman wore a similar outfit of navy blue.
5547	'Your name?" Kassad asked as they left the building with the shattered
5548	dome and walked through a dead city.
5549	'Moneta,' said his dream, 'or Mnemosyne, whichever name pleases you
5550	more."
5551	'Moneta,' whispered Kassad. He looked up at a small
5552	sun rising into a lapis sky. 'This is Hyperion?"
5553	'Yes."
5554	'How did I land? Suspensor field? Parachute?" 'You descended under a
5555	wing of gold foil." 'I don't hurt. There were no wounds?" 'They were
5556	tended to." 'What is this place?"
5557	'The City of Poets. Abandoned more than a hundred years ago. Beyond
5558	that hill lie the Time Tombs."
5559	'The Ouster assault boats that were following me?"
5560	'One landed nearby. The Pain Lord took the crew unto
5561	himself. The other two set down some distance away." 'Who is the Pain
5562	Lord?"
5563	'Come,' said Moneta. The dead city ended in desert.
5564	Fine sand slid across white marble half buried in dunes.
5565	To the west an Ouster dropship sat with its portals irised open. Nearby,
5566	on a fallen column, a thermcube yielded hot coffee and fresh-baked
5567	rolls. They ate and drank in silence.
5568	Kassad worked to recall the legends of Hyperion. 'The Pain Lord is the
5569	Shrike,' he said at last.
5570	'Of course."
5571	'You're from here... from the City of Poets?" Moneta smiled and slowly
5572	shook her head.
5573	Kassad finished his coffee and set the cup down. The feeling that he
5574	was in a dream persisted, much stronger than during any sim he had ever
5575	participated in. But the coffee had tasted pleasantly bitter; the sun
5576	was warm on his face and hands.
5577	'Come, Kassad,' said Moneta.
5578	They crossed expanses of cold sand. Kassad found himself glancing
5579	skyward, knowing that the Ouster torchship could lance them from
5580	orbit... then knowing with a sudden certainty that it would not.
5581	The Time Tombs lay in a valley. A low obelisk glowed softly. A stone
5582	sphinx seemed to absorb the light. A complex structure of twisted
5583	pylons threw shadows onto itself. Other tombs were silhouettes against
5584	the rising sun. Each of the tombs had a door and each door was open.
5585	Kassad knew that they had been open when the first explorers discovered
5586	the Tombs and that the structures were empty. More than three
5587	centuries of searching for hidden rooms, tombs, vaults, and passageways
5588	had been fruitless.
5589	'This is as far as you can go,' Moneta said as they neared the cliff at
5590	the head of the valley. 'The time tides are strong today."
5591	Kassad's tactical implant was silent. He had no comlog. He searched
5592	his memory. 'There are anti entropic forcefields around the Time
5593	Tombs,' he said.
5594	'Yes."
5595	'The tombs are ancient. The anti-entropic fields keep them from aging."
5596	'No,' said Moneta. 'The time tides drive the Tombs backward through
5597	time."
5598	'Backward through time,' Kassad repeated stupidly.
5599	'Look."
5600	Shimmering, miragelike, a tree of steel thorns appeared out of the haze
5601	and a sudden dust storm of ochre sand. The thing seemed to fill the
5602	valley, rising at least two hundred meters to the height of the cliffs.
5603	Branches shifted, dissolved, and reformed like elements of a poorly
5604	tuned hologram. Sunlight danced on five meter-long thorns. Corpses of
5605	Ouster men and women, all naked, were impaled on at least a score of
5606	these thorns. Other branches held other bodies. Not all were human.
5607	The dust storm obscured the view for a moment and when the winds
5608	subsided the vision was gone. 'Come,' said Moneta.
5609	Kassad followed her through the fringes of the time tides, avoiding the
5610	ebb and flow of the anti-entropic field the way children would play tag
5611	with an ocean surf on a broad beach. Kassad felt the pull of the time
5612	tides like waves of ddjd vu tugging at every cell of his body.
5613	Just beyond the entrance to the valley, where hills opened to the dunes
5614	and low moors led to the City of Poets, Moneta touched a wall of blue
5615	slate and an entrance opened to a long, low room set into the cliff
5616	face.
5617	'Is this where you live?" asked Kassad but saw immediately that there
5618	were no signs of habitation. The stone walls of the room were inset
5619	with shelves and crowded niches.
5620	'We must ready ourselves,' whispered Moneta and the lighting shifted to
5621	a golden hue. A long rack lowered its wares. A wafer-thin strip of
5622	reflective polymer curtained from the ceiling to serve as a mirror.
5623	Kassad watched with the calm passivity of a dreamer as Moneta stripped
5624	off her clothes and then his. Their nudity was no longer erotic, merely
5625	ceremonial.
5626	'You have been in my dreams for years,' he told her.
5627	'Yes. Your past. My future. The shock wave of events moves across
5628	time like ripples on a pond."
5629	Kassad blinked as she raised a gold ferule and touched his chest. He
5630	felt a slight shock and his flesh became a mirror, his head and face a
5631	featureless ovoid reflecting all the color tones and textures of the
5632	room. A second later Moneta joined him, her body becoming a cascade of
5633	reflections, water over quicksilver over chrome.
5634	Kassad saw his own reflecting reflection in every curve and muscle of
5635	her body. Moneta's breasts caught and bent the light; her nipples rose
5636	like small splashes on a mirrored pond. Kassad moved to embrace her and
5637	felt
5638	their surfaces flow together like magnetized fluid. Under the connected
5639	fields, his flesh touched hers.
5640	'Your enemies await beyond the city,' she whispered.
5641	The chrome of her face flowed with light.
5642	'Enemies?"
5643	'The Ousters. The ones who followed you here."
5644	Kassad shook his head, saw the reflection do likewise.
5645	'They're not important anymore."
5646	'Oh, yes,' whispered Moneta, 'the enemy is always important. You must
5647	arm yourself."
5648	'With what?" But even as he spoke, Kassad realized that she was touching
5649	him with a bronze sphere, a dull blue toroid. His altered body spoke to
5650	him now as clearly as troops reporting in on an implant command circuit.
5651	Kassad felt the bloodlust build in him with turgid strength.
5652	'Come." Moneta led the way into open desert again.
5653	The sunlight seemed polarized and heavy. Kassad felt that they were
5654	gliding across the dunes, flowing like liquid through the white marble
5655	streets of the dead city.
5656	Near the west end of town, near the shattered remnants of a structure
5657	still bearing the inscribed lintel of Poets' Amphitheatre, something
5658	stood waiting.
5659	For a second Kassad thought it was another person wearing the chromium
5660	forcefields he and Moneta were draped in - but only for a second. There
5661	was nothing human about this particular quicksilver-over-chrome
5662	construct. Kassad dreamily noted the four arms, retractable
5663	fingerblades, the profusion of thornspikes on throat, forehead, wrists,
5664	knees, and body, but not once did his gaze leave the two
5665	thousand-faceted eyes which burned with a red flame that paled sunlight
5666	and dimmed the day to blood shadows.
5667	The Shrike, thought Kassad.
5668	'The Lord of Pain,' whispered Moneta.
5669	The thing turned and led them out of the dead city.
5670	Kassad approved of the way the Ousters had prepared their defenses. The
5671	two assault boats were grounded less than half a kilometer apart, their
5672	guns, projectors, and missile turrets covering each other and a full
5673	three
5674	hundred and sixty degrees of fire. Ouster ground troops had been busy
5675	diing revetments a hundred meters out from the boats and Kassad could
5676	see at least two EM tanks hull down, their projection arrays and launch
5677	tubes commanding the wide, empty moor between the Poets' City and the
5678	boats. Kassad's vision had been altered; he could see the overlapping
5679	ship containment fields as ribbons of yellow haze, the motion sensors
5680	and antipersonnel mines as eggs of pulsing red light.
5681	He blinked, realizing that something was wrong with the image. Then it
5682	came to him: besides the thickness of the light and his enhanced
5683	perception of energy fields, nothing was moving. The Ouster troops,
5684	even those set in attitudes of motion, were as stiff as the toy soldiers
5685	he had played with as a boy in the Thatsis slums. The EM tanks were dug
5686	into their hull-down positions, but Kassad noticed that now even their
5687	acquisition radars - visible to him as concentric purple arcs - were
5688	motionless.
5689	He glanced skyward and saw some sort of large bird hanging in the sky,
5690	as unmoving as an insect frozen in amber. He passed a cloud of
5691	windblown dust hanging suspended, extended one chrome hand, and flicked
5692	spirals of particles to the ground.
5693	Ahead of them, the Shrike strode casually through the red maze of
5694	sensor-mines, stepped over the blue lines of tripbeams, ducked under the
5695	violet pulses of the autofire scanners, passed through the yellow
5696	containment field and the green wall of the sonic defense perimeter, and
5697	walked into the assault boat's shadow. Moneta and Kassad followed.
5698	--How is this possible? Kas,xi realized that he had posed the question
5699	through a medium that was something less than telepathy but something
5700	far more sophis ticated than implant conduction.
5701	--He controls time.
5702	-- The Pain Lord?
5703	--Of course.
5704	--Why are we here?
5705	Moneta gestured toward the motionless Ousters.
5706	-- They are your enemies.
5707	Kassad felt that he was finally awaking from a long
5708	dream. This was real. The Ouster trooper's eyes, unblinking behind his
5709	helmet, were real. The Ouster assault boat, rising like a bronze
5710	tombstone to his left, was real.
5711	Fedmahn Kassad realized that he could kill them all -commandos, assault
5712	boat crew, all of them- and they could do nothing about it. He knew
5713	that time had not stopped - any more than it stopped while a ship was
5714	under Hawking drive - it was merely a matter of varying rates. The bird
5715	frozen above them would complete the flap of its wings given enough
5716	minutes or hours. The Ouster in front of him would close his eyes in a
5717	blink if Kassad had the patience to watch long enough. Meanwhile,
5718	Kassad and Moneta and the Shrike could kill all of them without the
5719	Ousters realizing that they were under attack.
5720	It was not fair, Kassad realized. It was wrong. It was the ultimate
5721	violation of the New Bushido, worse in its way than the wanton murder of
5722	civilians. The essence of honor lay in the moment of combat between
5723	equals. He was about to communicate this to Moneta when she
5724	said/thought -- Watch.
5725	Time began again with an explosion of sound not unlike the rush of air
5726	into an airlock. The bird soared and circled overhead. A desert breeze
5727	threw dust against the static-charged containment field. An Ouster
5728	commando rose from one knee, saw the Shrike and the two human shapes,
5729	screamed something over his tactical comm channel, and raised his energy
5730	weapon.
5731	The Shrike did not seem to move - to Kassad it merely ceased being here
5732	and appeared there. The Ouster commando emitted a second, shorter
5733	scream, and then looked down in disbelief as the Shrike's arm withdrew
5734	with the man's heart in its bladed fist. The Ouster stared, opened his
5735	mouth as if to speak, and collapsed.
5736	Kassad turned to his right and found himself face to face with an
5737	armored Ouster. The commando ponderously lifted a weapon. Kassad swung
5738	his arm, felt the chrome forcefield hum, and saw the flat of his hand
5739	cut through body armor, helmet, and neck. The Ouster's head rolled in
5740	the dust.
5741	Kassad leaped into a low trench and saw several troopers begin to turn.
5742	Time was still out of joint; the enemy moved in extreme slow motion one
5743	second, jerked like a damaged holo to four-fifths speed in the next
5744	instant.
5745	They were never as quick as Kassad. Gone were his thoughts of the New
5746	Bushido. These were the barbarians who had tried to kill him. He broke
5747	one man's back, stepped aside, jabbed rigid, chrome fingers through the
5748	body armor of a second man, crushed the larynx of a third, dodged a
5749	knife blade moving in slow motion and kicked the spine out of the knife
5750	wielder. He leaped up
5751	out of the ditch.
5752	--Kassad!
5753	Kassad ducked as the laser beam crept past his shoulder, burning its way
5754	through the air like a slow fuse of ruby light. Kassad smelled ozone as
5755	it crackled past.
5756	Impossible. l've dodged a laser/He picked up a stone and flung it at
5757	the Ouster manning the tank-mounted he!iwhip. A sonic boom cracked; the
5758	gunner exploded backward. Kassad pulled a plasma grenade from a
5759	corpse's bandolier, leaped to the tank hatch, was thirty meters away
5760	before the explosion geysered flame as high as the assault boat's bow.
5761	Kassad paused in the eye of the storm to see Moneta in the center of her
5762	own circle of carnage. Blood splashed her but did not adhere, flowing
5763	like oil on water across the rainbow curves of chin, shoulder, breast,
5764	and belly.
5765	She looked at him across the battlefield and Kassad felt a renewed surge
5766	of bloodlust in himself.
5767	Behind her, the Shrike moved slowly through the chaos, choosing victims
5768	as if he were harvesting. Kassad watched the creature wink in and out
5769	of existence and real'-d that to the Pain Lord he and Moneta would
5770	appear to be moving as slowly as the Ousters did to Kassado
5771	Time jumped, moved to four-fifths speed. The surviving troops were
5772	panicking now, firing into one another, deserting their posts, and
5773	fighting to get aboard the assault boat. Kassad tried to realize what
5774	the past minute or two had been like for them: blurs moving through
5775	their defensive positions, comrades dying in
5776	great gouts of blood. Kassad watched Moneta moving through their ranks,
5777	killing at her leisure. To his amazement, he discovered that he had
5778	some control of time: blink and his opponents slowed to one-third speed,
5779	blink and events moved at nearly their normal pace. Kassad's sense of
5780	honor and sanity called out for him to stop the slaughter but his almost
5781	sexual bloodlust overpowered any objections.
5782	Someone in the assault boat had sealed the airlock and now a terrified
5783	commando used a shaped plasma charge to blow the portal open. The mob
5784	pressed in, trampling the wounded in their flight from unseen killers.
5785	Kassad followed them in.
5786	The phrase 'fight like a cornered rat' is an extremely apt description.
5787	Throughout the history of military encounters, human combatants have
5788	been known to fight at their fiercest when challenged in enclosed places
5789	where flight is not an option. Whether in the passageways of La Haye
5790	Sainte and Hougoumont at Waterloo or in the Hive tunnels of Lusus, some
5791	of the most terrible hand-to-hand battles in history have been fought in
5792	cramped spaces where no retreat is possible. It was true this day. The
5793	Ousters fought... and died... like cornered rats.
5794	The Shrike had disabled the assault boat. Moneta remained outside to
5795	kill the threescore commandos who had stayed at their posts. Kassad
5796	killed those within.
5797	In the end, the final assault boat fired on its doomed counterpart.
5798	Kassad was outside by then and he watched the particle beams and
5799	high-intensity lasers creep toward him, followed an eternity later by
5800	missiles which seemed to move so slowly that he could have written his
5801	name on them in flight. By that time all of the Ousters were dead in
5802	and around the overrun boat, but its containment field held. Energy
5803	dispersion and impact explosions tossed corpses around on the outer
5804	perimeter, set fire to equipment, and glazed the sand to glass, but
5805	Kassad and Moneta watched from inside a dome of orange flame as the
5806	remaining assault boat retreated to space.
5807	--Can we stop them? Kassad was panting, pouring sweat, and literally
5808	quivering from excitement.
5809	-- We could, replied Moneta, but we do not want to.
5810	They will carry the message to the swarm.
5811	--Wt message?
5812	'Come here, Kassad?
5813	He turned at the sound of her voice. The reflective forcefield was
5814	gone· Moneta's flesh was oiled with sweat; her dark hair was matted
5815	against her temples; her nipples were hard. 'Come here."
5816	Kassad glanced down at himself. His own forcefield was gone - he had
5817	willed it away - and he was more
5818	sexually excited than he could ever remember being.
5819	'Come here." Moneta whispered this time·
5820	Kassad went to her, lifted her, felt the sweat-slick smoothness of her
5821	buttocks as he carried her to an empty stretch of grass atop a
5822	wind-carved hummock. He lowered her to the ground between piles of
5823	Ouster bodies, roughly opened her legs, took both her hands in the grasp
5824	of one of his, lifted her arms above her head, pinned them to the
5825	ground, and lowered his long body between her legs.
5826	'Yes,' whispered Morteta as he kissed the lobe of her left ear, set his
5827	lips to the pulse at the hollow of her neck, licked the salt tang of
5828	sweat from her breasts. Lying among the dead. More dead to come. The
5829	thousands.
5830	The millions. Laughter out of dead bellies. The long lines of troops
5831	emerging from JumpShips to enter the waiting flames.
5832	'Yes." Her breath was hot in his ear. She freed her hands, slid them
5833	along Kassad's damp shoulders, trailed long nails down his back, grasped
5834	his buttocks to pull him closer. Kassad's erection scraped her pubic
5835	hair, throbbed against the cusp of her belly. Farcaster portals opening
5836	to admit the cold lengths of attack carriers. The warmth of plasma
5837	explosions. Hundreds of ships, thousands, dancing and dying like dust
5838	motes in a whirlwind.
5839	Great columns of solid ruby light lancing across great distances,
5840	bathing targets in the ultimate surge of warmth, bodies boiling in red
5841	light.
5842	'Yes." Moneta opened her mouth and body to him.
5843	Warmth above and below, her tongue in his mouth as he entered her,.
5844	welcomed by warm friction. His body
5845	strained deep, pulled back slightly, allowed the moist warmth to engulf
5846	him further as they began to move together. Heat on a hundred worlds.
5847	Continents burning in bright spasms, the roll of boiling seas. The air
5848	itself aflame. Oceans of superheated air swelling like warm skin rising
5849	to a lover's touch.
5850	'Yes... yes... yes." Moneta breathes warmth against his lips. Her
5851	skin is oil and velvet. Kassad thrusts quickly now, the universe
5852	contracting as sensation expands, senses dwindling as she closes warm
5853	and wet and tight around him. Her hips thrust harshly in response now,
5854	as if sensing the terrible build in pressure at the base of his being.
5855	Demanding. Kassad grimaces, closes his eyes, sees...
5856	· . . fireballs expanding, stars dying, suns exploding in great pulses
5857	of flame, star systems perishing in an ecstasy of destruction... .
5858	·.. he feels pain in his chest, his hips not stopping, moving faster,
5859	even as he opens his eyes and sees...
5860	... the great thorn of steel rising from between Moneta's breasts,
5861	almost impaling him as he unconsciously pulls up and back, the
5862	thornblade drawing blood which drips on her flesh, her pale flesh,
5863	reflective now, flesh as cold as dead metal, his hips still moving even
5864	as he watches through passion-dimmed eyes as Moneta's lips wither and
5865	curl back, revealing rows of steel blades where teeth had been, metal
5866	blades slash at his buttocks where fingers had gripped, legs like
5867	powerful steel bands imprison his pumping hips, her eyes· . .
5868	·.. in thelast seconds before orgasm Kassad tries to pull away· . .
5869	his hands on her throat, pressing·.. she clings like a leech, a lamprey
5870	ready to drain him... they roll against dead bodies...
5871	· . . her eyes like red jewels, blazing with a mad heat like that
5872	which fills his aching testicles, expanding like a flame, spillingover·
5873	. .
5874	· . . Kassad slams both hands against the soil, lifts himself away
5875	from her... from it... his strength insan but not enough as terrible
5876	gravities press them together...
5877	sucking like a lamprey's mouth as he threatens to explode, looks in her
5878	eyes· . . the death of worlds... the death of worlds!
5879	Kassad screams and pulls away. Strips of his flesh rip away as he
5880	lunges up and sideways. Metal teeth click shut in a steel vagina,
5881	missing his glans by a moist millimeter.
5882	Kassad slumps on his side, rolls away, hips moving, unable to stop his
5883	ejaculation. Semen explodes in streams, falls on the curled fist of a
5884	corpse. Kassad moans, rolls again, curls in a fetal position even as he
5885	comes again. And again.
5886	He hears the hiss and rustle as she rises behind him.
5887	Kassad rolls on his back and squints up against sunlight and his own
5888	pain. She stands above him, legs apart, a silhouette' of thorns. Kassad
5889	wipes sweat from his eyes, sees his wrist come away red with blood, and
5890	waits for the killing blow. His skin contracts in anticipation of the
5891	slash of blade into flesh. Panting, Kassad looks up to see Moneta above
5892	him, thighs flesh rather than steel, her groin matted from the moisture
5893	of their passion. Her face is dark, the sun behind her, but he sees red
5894	flames dying in the multifaceted pits of her eyes. She smiles and he
5895	sees sunlight glint on rows of metal teeth. 'Kassad · . ." she
5896	whispers and it is the sound of sand scraping against bone.
5897	Kassad tears his gaze away, struggles to his feet, and stumbles across
5898	corpses and burning rubble in his terror to be free. He does not look
5899	back.
5900	Scouting elements of Hyperion's Self-defense Force found Colonel Fedmahn
5901	Kassad almost two days later.
5902	He was discovered lying unconscious on one of the grassy moors which
5903	lead to the abandoned Chronos Keep, some twenty kilometers from the dead
5904	city and the wreckage of the Ouster ejection pod. Kassad was naked and
5905	almost dead from the effects of exposure and several serious wounds, but
5906	he responded well to emergency field treatment and was immediately
5907	airlifted south of the Bridle Range to a hospital at Keats·
5908	Reconnaissance squads from the SDF battalion moved northward carefully,
5909	cautious of the anti-entropic tides around the Time Tombs and wary of
5910	any booby traps left behind by the Ousters. There were none. The
5911	scouts found only the wreckage of Kassad's escape mechanism and the
5912	burned out hulks of the two assault boats which the Ousters had lanced
5913	from orbit. There were no clues as to why they had slagged their own
5914	ships and the Ouster bodies-both in and around the boats - had been
5915	burned beyond any hope of autopsy or analysis.
5916	Kassad regained consciousness three Hyperion days later, swore that he
5917	remembered nothing after stealing the squid, and was shipped out on a
5918	FORCE torchship two local weeks later.
5919	Upon returning to the Web, Kassad resigned his commission.
5920	For a while he was active in antiwar movements, occasionally appearing
5921	on the All Thing net arguing disarmament. But the attack on Bressia had
5922	mobilized the Hegemony toward true interstellar war as had nothing else
5923	in three centuries, and Kassad's voice was either drowned out or
5924	dismissed as the guilty conscience of the Butcher of South Bressia.
5925	In the sixteen years after Bressia, Colonel Kassad had disappeared from
5926	the Web and from the Web consciousness.
5927	Although there had been no more major battles, the Ousters remained the
5928	Hegemony's prime bogeymen.
5929	Fedmahn Kassad was only a fading memory.
5930	It was late morning when Kassad finished his story. The Consul blinked
5931	and looked around him, noticing the ship and its surroundings for the
5932	first time in more than two hours. The Benares had come out into the
5933	main channel of the Hoolie. The Consul could hear the creaks of the
5934	chains and hawsers as the river mantas surged against their harnesses.
5935	The Benares appeared to be the only ship heading upriver, but now
5936	numerous small craft were visible going the other way. The Consul
5937	rubbed his forehead and was surprised to see his hand come away slick
5938	with sweat. The day had grown very warm and the shadow of the tarp had
5939	crept away from the Consul without his noticing. He blinked, wiped
5940	sweat from his eyes, and moved into the shade to get a drink from one of
5941	the liquor bottles the androids had set in a cabinet near the table.
5942	'My God,' Father Hoyt was saying, 'so, according to this Moneta
5943	creature, the Time Tombs are moving backward in time?"
5944	'Yes,' said Kassad.
5945	'Is that possible?" asked Hoyt.
5946	'Yes." It was Sol Weintraub who answered.
5947	'If that's true,' said Brawne Lamia, 'then you "met" this Moneta... or
5948	whatever her real name is... in her past but your future ... in a
5949	meeting that's still to come."
5950	'Yes,' said Kassad.
5951	Martin Silenus walked to the railing and spat into the river. 'Colonel,
5952	do you think the bitch was the Shrike?"
5953	'I don't know." Kassad's monotone was barely audible.
5954	Silenus turned to Sol Weintraub. 'You're a scholar. Is there anything
5955	in the Shrike mythography that says the thing can change shape?"
5956	'No,' said Weintraub. He was preparing a milk globe to feed his
5957	daughter. The infant made soft, mewling noises and moved tiny fingers.
5958	'Colonel,' said Het Masteen, 'the forcefield... whatever the fighting
5959	suit was... did you bring it with you after the encounter with the
5960	Ousters and this ...
5961	female?"
5962	Kassad looked at the Templar a moment and then shook his head.
5963	The Consul was staring into his drink but his head suddenly snapped
5964	upright with the force of a thought.
5965	'Colonel, you said that you saw a vision of the Shrikc's killing tree...
5966	the structure, the thing where it impales its victims."
5967	Kassad moved his basilisk stare from the Templar to the Consul. He
5968	slowly nodded.
5969	'And there were bodies on it?"
5970	Another nod.
5971	The Consul wiped sweat from his upper lip. 'If the tree is traveling
5972	backward in time with the Time Tombs, then the victims are from our
5973	future."
5974	Kassad said nothing. The others also were staring at the Consul now but
5975	only Weintraub appeared to understand what the comment meant... and
5976	what the Con-sul's next question had to be.
5977	The Consul resisted the urge to wipe the sweat from his
5978	lips again. His voice was steady. 'Did you see any of us there?"
5979	Kassad said nothing for more than a minute. The soft sounds of the
5980	river and the ship's rigging suddenly seemed very loud. Finally Kassad
5981	took a breath. 'Yes."
5982	Silence stretched again. Brawne Lamia broke it. 'Will you tell us
5983	who?"
5984	'No." Kassad rose and went to the stairway leading to the lower decks.
5985	'Wait,' called Father Hoyt.
5986	Kassad paused at the head of the stairway.
5987	'Will you at least tell us two other things?" 'What?"
5988	Father Hoyt grimaced from a wave of pain. His gaunt face went white
5989	under its film of perspiration. He took a breath and said, 'First, do
5990	you think the Shrike... the woman... somehow wants to use you to start
5991	this terrible interstellar war you foresaw?"
5992	'Yes,' Kassad said softly.
5993	'Second, will you tell us what you plan to petition the Shrike for... or
5994	this Moneta... when you meet them on the pilgrimage?"
5995	Kassad smiled for the first time. It was a thin smile, and very, very
5996	cold. 'I will make no petition,' said Kassad. 'I will ask nothing of
5997	them. When I meet them this time, I will kill them:'
5998	The other pilgrims did not speak or look at one another as Kassad went
5999	below. The Benares continued north-northeast into afternoon.
6000	THREE
6001	The barge Benares entered the river port of Naiad an hour before sunset.
6002	Crew and pilgrims pressed to the rail to stare at smoldering embers of
6003	what once had been a city of twenty thousand people. Little remained.
6004	The famous River Front Inn, built in the days of Sad King Billy, had
6005	burned to the foundations; its charred docks, piers, and screened
6006	balconies now collapsed into the shallows of the Hoolie. The
6007	customhouse was a burned-out shell. The airship terminal on the north
6008	end of town survived only as a blackened hulk, its mooring tower reduced
6009	to a spire of charcoal. There was no sign whatsoever of the small
6010	riverfront Shrike temple. Worst of all, from the pilgrims' point of
6011	view, was the destruction of the Naiad River Station - the harness dock
6012	lay burned and sagging, the manta holding pens open to the river.
6013	'God damn it!" said Martin Silenus.
6014	'Who did it?" asked Father Hoyt. 'The Shrike?"
6015	'More likely the SDF,' said the Consul. 'Although they may have been
6016	fighting the Shrike."
6017	'I can't believe this,' snapped Brawne Lamia. She turned to A. Bettik,
6018	who had just joined them on the rear deck. 'Didn't you know this had
6019	happened?"
6020	'No,' said the android. 'There has been no contact with any point north
6021	of the locks for more than a week."
6022	'Why the hell not?" asked Lamia. 'Even if this godforsaken world
6023	doesn't have a datasphere, don't you have radio?"
6024	A. Bettik smiled slightly. 'Yes, M. Lamia, there is radio, but the
6025	comsats are down, the microwave repeater stations at the Karla Locks
6026	were destroyed, and we have no access to shortwave."
6027	'What about'the mantas?" asked Kassad. 'Can we press on to Edge with
6028	the ones we have."?"
6029	Bettik frowned. 'We will have to, Colonel,' he said.
6030	'But it is a crime. The two in harness will not recover from such a
6031	pull. With fresh mantas we would have put into Edge before dawn. With
6032	these two..." The android shrugged. 'With luck, if the beasts survive,
6033	we will arrive by early afternoon..."
6034	'The windwagon will still be there, will it not?" asked Het Masteen.
6035	'We must assume so,' said A. Bettik. 'If you will excuse me, I will
6036	see to feeding the poor beasts we have.
6037	We should be under way again within the hour."
6038	They saw no one in or near the ruins of Naiad. No river craft made
6039	their appearance above the city. An hour's pull northeast of the town
6040	they entered the region where the forests and farms of the lower Hoolie
6041	gave way to the undulating orange prairie south of the Sea of Grass.
6042	Occasionally the Consul would see the 'mud towers of architect ants,
6043	some of their serrated structures near the river reaching almost ten
6044	meters in height. There was no sign of intact human habitation. The
6045	ferry at Betty's Ford was totally gone, with not even a towrope or
6046	warming shack left to show where it had stood for almost two centuries.
6047	The River Runners Inn at Cave Point was dark and silent. A. Bettik and
6048	other crew members hallooed, but there was no response from the black
6049	cave mouth.
6050	Sunset brought a sensuous stillness over the river, soon broken by a
6051	chorus of insect noises and night-bird calls. For a while the surface
6052	of the Hoolie became a mirror of the gray-green disk of twilight sky,
6053	disturbed only by the leap of dusk-feeding fish and the wake of the
6054	laboring mantas. As true darkness fell, innumerable prairie gossamers -
6055	much paler than their forest cousins, but also of greater wingspan,
6056	luminescent shades the size of small children - danced in the vales and
6057	valleys of the gently rolling hills. By the time the constellations
6058	emerged and the meteor trails began scarring the night sky, a brilliant
6059	display this far from all man-made light, the lanterns had been lit and
6060	dinner set out on the aft deck.
6061	The Shrike pilgrims were subdued, as if still contemplating Colonel
6062	Kassad's grim and confusing tale. The Consul had been drinking steadily
6063	since before midday and now he felt the pleasant displacement - from
6064	reality, from the pain of memory - which allowed him to get through each
6065	day and night. Now he asked, his voice as careful and unslurred as only
6066	a true alcoholic's can be, whose turn it was to tell a tale.
6067	'Mine,' said Martin Silenus. The poet also had been drinking steadily
6068	since early in the day. His voice was as carefully controlled as the
6069	Consul's but redness on his sharp cheeks and an almost manic brightness
6070	of eye gave the old poet away. 'At least I drew number three..." He
6071	held up his slip of paper. 'If you still want to hear the fucking
6072	thing."
6073	Brawne Lamia lifted her glass of wine, scowled, and set it down.
6074	'Perhaps we should talk about what we have learned from the first two
6075	stories and how it might relate to our current... situation."
6076	'Not yet,' said Colonel Kassad. 'We don't have enough information."
6077	'Let M. Silenus speak,' said Sol Weintruab. 'Then we
6078	can begin discussing what we have heard."
6079	'I agree,' said Lenar Hoyt.
6080	Het Mastcen and the Consul nodded.
6081	'Agreed!" cried Martin Silenus. 'I'II tell my story. Just let me
6082	finish my fucking glass of wine."
6083	THE POET'S TALE: 'Hyperion Cantos'
6084	In the beginning was the Word. Then came the fucking word processor.
6085	Then came the thought processor. Then came the death of literature. And
6086	so it goes.
6087	Francis Bacon once said, 'There arises from a bad and unapt formation of
6088	words a wonderful obstruction to the mind." We have all contributed our
6089	wonderful obstructions to the mind, have we not? I more than most. One
6090	of the twentieth century's better, forgotten writers- that is
6091	better-comma-forgotten, once bon
6092	rnoted: 'i love being a writer. It's the paperwork I can't stand." Get
6093	it? Well, amigos and amigette, I love being a
6094	poet. It's the goddamned words I can't stand.
6095	Where to start?
6096	Start with Hyperion perhaps?
6097	(Fade in) Almost two standard centuries ago.
6098	Sad King Billy's five seedships spin like gold dandelions above this all
6099	too familiar lapis sky. We land like conquistadors strutting to and
6100	fro; more than two thousand visual artists and writers and sculptors and
6101	poets and ARNists and vid makers and holie directors and composers and
6102	decomposers and God knows what all, supported by five times that many
6103	administrators and technicians and ecologists and supervisors and court
6104	chamberlains and professional ass kissers, not to mention the family of
6105	royal asses themselves, supported in turn by ten times that many
6106	androids willing to till the soil and stoke the reactors and raise the
6107	cities and lift that bale and tote that load... hell, you get the idea.
6108	We landed on a world already seeded by the poor buggers who'd gone
6109	indigenie two centuries before and were living hand to mouth and cudgel
6110	to brain wherever they could. Naturally the noble descendants of these
6111	brave pioneers greeted us like gods - especially after a few of our
6112	security folk slagged a few of their more aggressive leaders- and
6113	naturally we accepted their worship as our due and put them to work next
6114	to our blueskins, plowing the south forty and working to build our
6115	shining city on the hill.
6116	And it was a shining city on a hill. Seeing the ruins today can tell
6117	you nothing of the place. The desert had advanced in three centuries;
6118	the aqueducts from the mountains have fallen and shattered; the city
6119	itself is only bones. But in its day the City of Poets was fair indeed,
6120	a bit of Socrates's Athens with the intellectual excitement of
6121	Renaissance Venice, the artistic fervor of Paris in the days of the
6122	Impressionists, the true democracy of the first decade of Orbit City,
6123	and the unlimited future of Tau Ceti Center.
6124	But, in the end, it was none of these things, of course.
6125	It was only Hrothgar's claustrophobic mead hall with
6126	the monster waiting in the darkness without. We had our Grendel, to be
6127	sure. We even had our Hrothgar if one squints a bit at Sad King Billy's
6128	poor slouched profile.
6129	We lacked only our Geats; our great, broad-shouldered, small-brained
6130	Beowulf with his band of merry psycho-paths.
6131	So, lacking a Hero, we settled into the role of victims and composed our
6132	sonnets and rehearsed our ballets and unrolled our scrolls, while all
6133	the while our thorn-and-steel Grendel served the night with fear and
6134	harvested thighbones and gristle.
6135	And this was when I - a satyr then, formed in flesh as mirror to my soul
6136	- came as close to completing my Cantos, my life's work, as I have come
6137	in five sad centuries of
6138	stubborn continuance.
6139	(Fade to black)
6140	It occurs to me that the Grendel tale is premature. The players have
6141	not been brought upon the stage. Dislinear plotting and non-contiguous
6142	prose have their adherents, not the least of which am I, but in the end,
6143	my friends, it is character which wins or loses immortality upon the
6144	vellum. Haven't you ever harbored the secret thought that somewhere
6145	Huck and Jim are- at this instant-poling their raft down some river just
6146	beyond our reach, so much more real are they than the shoe clerk who
6147	fitted us just a forgotten day ago? At any rate, if this fucking
6148	story's to be told, you should know who's in it. So --as much as it
6149	pains me - VII back up to begin at the beginning.
6150	In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was programmed in classic
6151	binary. And the Word said, 'Let there be life!" And so, somewhere in
6152	the TechnoCore vaults of my mother's estate, frozen sperm from my
6153	long-dead daddy was defrosted, set in suspension, shaken like the
6154	vanilla malts of yore, loaded into something part squirt gun and part
6155	dildo, and - at the magic touch of a trigger - ejaculated into Mother at
6156	a time when the moon was full and the egg was ripe.
6157	Mother didn't have to be impregnated in this barbaric fashion, of
6158	course. She could have chosen ex utero fertilization, a male lover with
6159	a transplant of Daddy's
6160	DNA, a clonal surrogate, a gene-spliced virgin birth, you name it...
6161	but, as she told me later, she opened her legs
6162	to tradition. My guess is that she preferred it that way.
6163	Anyway, I was born.
6164	I was born on Earth... Old Earth... and fuck you, Lamia, if you don't
6165	believe it. We lived on Mother's estate on an island not far from the
6166	North American Preserve.
6167	Notes for sketch of home on Old Earth:
6168	Fragile twilights fading from violet to fuchsia to purple above the
6169	crepe-paper silhouettes of trees beyond the southwest sweep of lawn.
6170	Skies as delicate as translucent china, unscarred by cloud or contrail.
6171	The presymphony hush of first light followed by the cymbal crash of
6172	sunrise. Oranges and russets igniting to gold, the long, cool descent
6173	to green: leaf shadow, shade, tendrils of cypress and weeping willow,
6174	the hushed green velvet of the glade.
6175	Mother's estate - our estate - a thousand acres centered in a million
6176	more. Lawns the size of small prairies with grass so perfect it
6177	beckoned a body to lie on it, to nap on its soft perfection. Noble
6178	shade trees making sundials of the Earth, their shadows circling in
6179	stately procession; now mingling, now contracting to midday, finally
6180	stretching eastward with the dying of the day.
6181	Royal oak. Giant elms. Cottonwood and cypress and redwood and bonsai.
6182	Banyan trees lowering new trunks like smooth-sided columns in a temple
6183	roofed by sky.
6184	Willows lining carefully laid canals and haphazard streams, their
6185	hanging branches singing ancient dirges to the wind.
6186	Our house rises on a low hill where, in the winter, the browning curves
6187	of lawn look like the smooth flank of some female beast, all thigh
6188	muscle and meant for speed.
6189	The house shows its centuries of accretion: a jade tower on the east
6190	courtyard catching the first light of dawn, a series of gables on the
6191	south wing throwing triangles of shadow on the crystal conservatory at
6192	teatime, the balconies and maze of exterior stairways along the east
6193	porticoes playing Escher games with afternoon's shadows.
6194	It was after the Big Mistake but before everything grew uninhabitable.
6195	Mostly we occupied the estate during what we quaintly called 'periods of
6196	remission'-stretches of ten to eighteen quiet months between planet-wide
6197	spasms as the Kiev Team's goddamn little black hole digested bits of the
6198	Earth's center and waited for its next feast. During the 'Bad Times,'
6199	we vacationed at Uncle Kowa's place out beyond the moon, on a
6200	terra-formed asteroid brought there before the Ouster migration.
6201	You might already be able to tell that I was born with a silver spoon up
6202	my ass. I offer no apologies. After three thousand years of dabbling
6203	with democracy, the remaining Old Earth families had come to the
6204	realization that the only way to avoid such riffraff was not to allow
6205	them to breed. Or, rather, to sponsor seedship fleets; spinship
6206	explorations, new farcaster migrations ... all of the panicked urgency
6207	of the Hegira... as long as they bred out there and left Old Earth
6208	alone. The fact that the homeworld was a diseased old bitch, gone in
6209	the teeth, didn't hurt the riffraff's urge to pioneer. No fools they.
6210	And like the Buddha, I was almost grown before I saw my first hint of
6211	poverty. I was sixteen standard years old, on my Wanderjahr, and
6212	backpacking through India when I saw a beggar. The Hindu Old Families
6213	kept them around for religious reasons, but all I knew at the time was
6214	that here was a man in rags, ribs showing, holding out a wicker basket
6215	with an ancient credit diskey in it, begging for a touch of my universal
6216	card. My friends thought it was hysterical. I threw up. It was in
6217	Benares.
6218	My childhood was privileged but not obnoxiously so. I have pleasant
6219	memories of Grande Dame Sybil's famous parties (she was a great-aunt on
6220	my mother's side). I remember one three-day affair she threw in the
6221	Manhattan Archipelago, guests ferried in by dropship from Orbit City and
6222	from the European arcologies. I remember the Empire State Building
6223	rising from the water, its many lights reflecting on the lagoons and
6224	fern canals; the EMVs unloading passengers on the observation deck while
6225	cooking fires burned on the overgrown island mounds of lower buildings
6226	all around.
6227	The North American Preserve was our private playground in those days. It
6228	was said that about eight thousand people still resided in that
6229	mysterious continent, but half of these were rangers. The rest included
6230	the renegade ARNists who plied their trade by resurrecting species of
6231	plants and animals long absent from their antediluvian North American
6232	haunts, the ecology engineers, licensed primitives such as the Ogalalla
6233	Sioux or the He!l's Angel Guild, and the occasional tourist. I had a
6234	cousin who reportedly backpacked from one observation zone to the other
6235	in the Preserve, but he did so in the Midwest where the zones were
6236	relatively close together and where the dinosaur herds were much
6237	scarcer.
6238	In the first century after the Big Mistake, Gaea was mortally injured
6239	but slow in the dying. The devastation was great during the Bad Times -
6240	and these came more often in precisely plotted spasms, shorter
6241	remissions, more terrible consequences after each attack - but the Earth
6242	abided and repaired itself as best it could.
6243	The Preserve was, as I say, our playground but, in a real sense, so was
6244	all of the dying Earth. Mother let me have my own EMV when I was seven
6245	and there was no place on the globe farther than an hour's flight from
6246	home. My best friend, Amalfi Schwartz, lived in the Mount Erebus
6247	Estates in what had once been the Antarctic Republic. We saw each other
6248	daily. The fact that Old Earth law forbade farcasters did not bother us
6249	in the least; lying on some hillside at night looking up through the ten
6250	thousand Orbiting Lights and the twenty thousand beacons of the Ring, at
6251	the two or three thousand visible stars, we felt no jealousy, no urge to
6252	join the Hegira that even then was spinning the farcaster silk of the
6253	Worldweb. We were happy.
6254	My memories of Mother are oddly stylized, as if she were another
6255	fictional construct from one of my Dying Earth novels. Perhaps she was.
6256	Perhaps I was raised by robots in the automated cities of Europe,
6257	suckled by androids in the Amazon Desert, or simply grown in a vat like
6258	brewer's yeast. What I recall is Mother's white gown sliding ghostlike
6259	through the shadowed rooms of the estate; infinitely delicate blue veins
6260	on the back of her
6261	thin-fingered hand as she poured tea in the damask and dust light of the
6262	conservatory; candlelight caught like a gold fly in the spiderweb sheen
6263	of her hair, hair done up in a bun in the style of the Grandes Dames.
6264	Sometimes I dream that I remember her voice, the lilt and tone and
6265	turn-in-the-womb centerhess of it, but then I awake and it becomes only
6266	the wind moving lace curtains or the sound of some alien sea on stone.
6267	From my earliest sense of self, I knew that I would be - should be - a
6268	poet. It was not as if I had a choice; more like the dying beauty all
6269	about breathed its last breath in me and commanded that I be doomed to
6270	play with words the rest of my days, as if in expiation for our race's
6271	thoughtless slaughter of its crib world. So what the hell; I became a
6272	poet.
6273	I had a tutor whose name was Balthazar, human but ancient, a refugee
6274	from ancient Alexandria's flesh-scented alleys. Balthazar all but
6275	glowed blue-white from those crude, early Poulsen treatments; he was
6276	like an irradiated mummy of a man, sealed in liquid plastic.
6277	And randy as the proverbial goat. Centuries later, when I was in my
6278	satyr period, I felt that I finally understood poor don Balthazar's
6279	priapic compulsions, but in those days it was mostly a hindrance to
6280	keeping young girls on the estate's staff. Human or android, don
6281	Baitbazar did not discriminate - he poinked them all.
6282	Luckily for my education, there was nothing homosexual in don
6283	Balthazar's addiction to young flesh, so his escapades evidenced
6284	themselves either as absences from our tutorial sessions or an
6285	inordinate amount of attention lavished on memorizing verses from Ovid,
6286	Senesh, or Wu.
6287	He was an excellent tutor. We studied the ancients and the late
6288	classical period, took field trips to the ruins of Athens, Rome, London,
6289	and Hannibal, Missouri, and never once had a quiz or test. Don
6290	Balthazar expected me to learn everything by heart at first encounter
6291	and I did not disappoint him. He convinced my mother that the pitfalls
6292	of 'progressive education' were not for an Old Earth family, so ! never
6293	knew the mind-stunting shortcuts of RNA medication, datasphere
6294	immersion,
6295	systemic flashback training, stylized encounter groups, 'higher-level
6296	thinking skills' at the expense of facts, or preliterate programming. As
6297	a result of these deprivations, I was able to recite all of Fitzgerald's
6298	translation of the Odyssey by the time I was six, compose a sestina
6299	before I could dress myself, and think in spiral fugue-verse before I
6300	ever interfaced with an AI.
6301	My scientific education, on the other hand, was something less than
6302	stringent. Don Balthazar had little interest in what he referred to as
6303	'the mechanical side of the universe." I was twenty-two before I
6304	realized that computers, RMUs, and Uncle Kowa's asteroidal life-support
6305	devices were machines and not some benevolent manifestations of the
6306	animas around us. I believed in fairies, woodsprites, numerology,
6307	astrology, and the magic of Midsummer's Eve deep in the primitive
6308	forests of the NAP. Like Keats and Lamb in Haydon's studio, don
6309	Balthazar and I drank toasts to 'the confusion of mathematics' ancl
6310	mourned the destruction of' the poetry of the rainbow by M. Newton's
6311	prying prism.. The early distrust and actual hatred of all things
6312	scientific and clinical served me well in later life. It is not
6313	difficult, I have learned, to remain a pre-Copernican pagan in the
6314	postscientific Hegemony.
6315	My early poetry was execrable. As with most bad poets, I was unaware of
6316	this fact, secure in my arrogance that the very act of creating gave
6317	some worth to the worthless abortions I was spawning. My mother
6318	remained tolerant even as I left reeking little piles of doggerel lying
6319	around the house. She was indulgent of her only child even if he was as
6320	blithely incontinent as an unhousebroken llama.
6321	Don Balthazar never commented on my work; primarily, I assume, because I
6322	never showed him any of it. Don Baithazar thought that the venerable
6323	Daton was a fraud, that Salmud Brevy and Robert Frost should have hanged
6324	themselves with their own entrails, that Wordsworth was a fool, and that
6325	anything less than Shakespeare's sonnets was a profanation of the
6326	language. I saw no reason to bother don Baitbazar with my verse, rife
6327	with budding genius though I knew it to be.
6328	I published several of these little literary turds in the various
6329	hardcopy journals then in vogue in the various arcologies of the
6330	European Houses, the amateur editors of these crude journals being as
6331	indulgent of my mother as she was of me. Occasionally I would press
6332	Amalfi or one of my other playmates - less aristocratic than I and thus
6333	with access to the datasphere or fatline transmitters - to uplink some
6334	of my verses to the Ring or to Mars, and thus to the burgeoning
6335	farcaster colonies.
6336	They never replied. I assumed they were too busy.
6337	Belief in one's identity as a poet or writer prior to the acid test of
6338	publication is as naive and harmless as the youthful belief in one's
6339	immortality... and the inevitable disillusionment is just as painful.
6340	My mother died with Old Earth. About half the Old Families stayed
6341	during that last cataclysm; I was twenty years old then and had made my
6342	own romantic plans to die with the homeworld. Mother decided otherwise.
6343	What concerned her was not my premature demise - like me, she was far
6344	too self-centered to think of someone else at a time like that - nor
6345	even the fact that the death of my DNA would mark the end of a line of
6346	aristocrats which stretched back to the Mayflower;, no, what bothered
6347	Mother was that the family was going to die out in debt. Our last
6348	hundred years of extravagance, it seems, had been financed through
6349	massive loans from the Ring Bank and other discreet extraterrestrial
6350	institutions.
6351	Now that the continents of Earth were crashing under the impact of
6352	contraction, the great forests aflame, the oceans heaving and heating
6353	themselves into a lifeless soup, the very air transforming itself into
6354	something too hot and thick to break and too thin to plow, now the banks
6355	wanted their money back. I was collateral.
6356	Or, rather, Mother's plan was. She liquidated all available assets some
6357	weeks before that phrase became a literal reality, deposited a quarter
6358	of a million marks in long-term accounts in the fleeing Ring Bank, and
6359	dispatched me on a trip to the Rifkin Atmospheric Protectorate on
6360	Heaven's Gate, a minor world circling the star Vega. Even then, that
6361	poisonous world had a
6362	farcaster connection to Sol System, but I did not farcast.
6363	Nor was I a passenger on the single spinship with Hawking drive which
6364	put into Heaven's Gate each standard year. No, Mother sent me to this
6365	back end of the outback on a Phase Three ramship, slower than light,
6366	frozen with the cattle embryos and orange juice concentrate and feeder
6367	viruses, on a trip that took one hundred and twenty-nine shipboard
6368	years, with an objective time-debt of one hundred and sixty-seven
6369	standard years!
6370	Mother figured that the accrued interest on the long-term accounts would
6371	be enough to pay off our family debt and perhaps allow me to survive
6372	comfortably for a while. For the first and last time in her life,
6373	Mother figured wrong.
6374	Notes for a sketch of Heaven's Gate:
6375	Mud lanes which run back from the station's conversion docks like a
6376	pattern of sores on a leper's back.
6377	Sufrus-brown clouds which hang in tatters from a rotten burlap sky. A
6378	tangle of shapeless wooden structures half decayed before they were ever
6379	fully constructed, their paneless windows now staring sightlessly into
6380	the gaping mouths of their neighbors. lndigenies breeding like...
6381	like humans, I suppose ... eyeless cripples, lungs burned out with air
6382	rot, squiring a nest of a dozen offspring, the children's skin scabrous
6383	by age five-standard, their eyes watering incessantly from the sting of
6384	an atmosphere which will kill them before they're forty, their smiles
6385	carious, their oily hair rife with lice and the blood bags of dracula
6386	ticks. Proud parents beaming. Twenty million of these doomed schmucks,
6387	crowded into slums overflowing an island smaller than my family's west
6388	lawn on Old Earth, all of them fighting to breathe the only breathable
6389	air on a world where the standard is to inhale and die, crowding ever
6390	closer to the center of the sixty-mile radius of survivable atmosphere
6391	which the Atmospheric Generating Station had been
6392	able to provide before it began to malfunction.
6393	Heaven's Gate: my new home.
6394	Mother had not taken into account the possibility that all Old Earth
6395	accounts would be frozen- and then
6396	appropriated into the growing Worldweb economy. Nor had she remembered
6397	that the reason people had waited for the Hawking drive to see the
6398	spiral arm of the galaxy is that in long-term cryogenic sleep - as
6399	opposed to a few weeks or months of fugue - chances of terminal brain
6400	damage were one in six. I was lucky. When I was uncrated on Heaven's
6401	Gate and put to work digging out acid canals beyond the perimeter, I had
6402	suffered only a cerebral accident - a stroke. Physically, I was able to
6403	work in the mud pits within a few local weeks. Mentally, there was much
6404	left to be desired.
6405	The left side of my brain had been shut down like a damaged section of a
6406	spinship being sealed off, airtight doors leaving the doomed
6407	compartments open to vacuum. I could still think. Control of the right
6408	side of my body soon returned. Only the language centers had been
6409	damaged beyond simple repair. The marvelous organic computer wedged in
6410	my skull had dumped its language content like a flawed program. The
6411	right hemisphere was not without some language - but only the most
6412	emotionally charged units of communication could lodge in that affective
6413	hemisphere; my vocabulary was now down to nine words. (This, I learned
6414	later, was exceptional, many victims of CVAs retain only two or three.)
6415	For the record, here is my entire vocabulary of manageable words: fuck,
6416	shit, piss, cunt, goddamn, motherfucker, asshole, peepee, and poopoo.
6417	A quick analysis will show some redundancy here. I had at my disposal
6418	eight nouns, which stood for six things; five of the eight nouns could
6419	double as verbs. I retained one indisputable noun and a single
6420	adjective which also could be used as a verb or expletive. My new
6421	language universe was comprised of four monosyllables, three compound
6422	words, and two baby-talk repetitions.
6423	My arena of literal expression offered four avenues to the topic of
6424	elimination, two references to human anatomy, one request for divine
6425	imprecation, one standard description of or request for coitus, and a
6426	coital variation which was no longer an option for me since my mother
6427	was deeeased.
6428	All in all, it was enough.
6429	I will not say that I remember my three years in the mud pits and slime
6430	slums of Heaven's Gate with fondnexs, but it is true that these years
6431	were at least as formative as - and probably more so than - my previous
6432	two decades on Old Earth.
6433	I soon found that among my intimate acquaintances - Old Sludge, the
6434	scoop-shovel foreman; Unk, the slum-yard bully to whom I paid my
6435	protection bribes; Kiti, the lice-ridden crib doxy whom I slept with
6436	when I could afford it - my vocabulary served me well. 'Shit-fuck,' I
6437	would grunt, gesticulating. 'Asshole cunt peepec fuck."
6438	'Ah,' grinned Old Sludge, showing his one tooth, 'going to the company
6439	store to get some algae chewies, huh?"
6440	'Goddamn poopoo,' I would grin back at him.
6441	The life of a poet lies not merely in the finite language-dance of
6442	expression but in the nearly infinite combinations of perception and
6443	memory combined with the sensitivity to what is perceived and
6444	remembered. My three local years on Heaven's Gate, almost fifteen
6445	hundred standard days, allowed me to see, to feel, to hear -to remember,
6446	as if I literally had been born again. Little matter that I had been
6447	born again in hell; reworked experience is the stuff of all true poetry
6448	and raw experience was the birthing gift of my new life.
6449	There was no problem adapting to a brave new world a century and a half
6450	beyond my own. For all of our talk of expansion and pioneering spirit
6451	these past five centuries, we all know how stultified and static our
6452	human universe has become. We are in a comfortable Dark Ages of the
6453	inventive mind; institutions change but little, and that by gradual
6454	evolution rather than revolution; scientific research creeps crablike in
6455	a lateral shuffle, where once it leaped in great intuitive bounds;
6456	devices change even less, plateau technologies common to us would be
6457	instantly identifiable- and operable!- to our great-grandfathers.
6458	So while I slept the Hegemony became a formal entity, the Worldweb was
6459	spun to something close to its final shape, the All Thing took its
6460	democratic place among the list of humanity's benevolent despots, the
6461	TechnoCore seceded from human service and then offered its help as an
6462	ally rather than a slave, and the Ousters retreated to darkness and the
6463	role of Nemesis · . . but all these things had been creeping toward
6464	critical mass even before I was frozen into my ice coffin between the
6465	pork bellies and sherbet, and such obvious extensions of old trends took
6466	little effort to understand. Besides, history viewed from the inside is
6467	always a dark, digestive mess, far different from the easily
6468	recognizable cow viewed from afar by historians.
6469	My life was Heaven's Gate and the minute-to-minute demands of survival
6470	there. The sky was always an eternal yellow-brown sunset hanging like a
6471	collapsing ceiling mere meters above my shack. My shack was oddly
6472	comfortable: a table for eating, a cot for sleeping and fucking, a hole
6473	for pissing and shitting, and a window for silent staring. My
6474	environment mirrored my vocabulary.
6475	Prison always has been a good place for writers, killing, as it does,
6476	the twin demons of mobility and diversion, and Heaven's Gate was no
6477	exception. The Atmospheric Protectorate owned my body but my mind - or
6478	what was left of it - was mine.
6479	On Old Earth, my poetry was composed on a Sadu-Dekenar cornlog thought
6480	processor while I lounged in a padded chaise Iongue or floated in my EM
6481	barge above dark lagoons or walked pensively through scented bowers.
6482	The execrable, undisciplined, limp-wristed flatulent products of those
6483	reveries already have been described.
6484	On Heaven's Gate, I discovered what a mental stimulant physical labor
6485	could be; not mere physical labor, I should add, but absolutely
6486	spine-bending, lung-racking, gut-ripping, ligament-tearing, and
6487	ball-breaking physical labor. But as long as the task is both onerous
6488	and repetitive, I discovered, the mind is not only free to wander to
6489	more imaginative climes, it actually flees to higher planes.
6490	Thus, on Heaven's Gate, as I dredged bottom scum from the slop canals
6491	under the red gaze of Vega Primo or crawled on hands and knees through
6492	stalactites and
6493	stalagmites of rebreather bacteria in labyrinthine lungpipes, I became a
6494	poet.
6495	All I lacked were the words.
6496	the station's
6497	The twentieth century's most honored writer, William Gass, once said in
6498	an interview; 'Words are the supreme objects. They are minded things."
6499	And so they are. As pure and transcendent as any Idea which ever cast a
6500	shadow into Plato's dark cave of our perceptions. But they are also
6501	pitfalls of deceit and misperception. Words bend our thinking to
6502	infinite paths of self-delusion, and the fact that we spend most of our
6503	mental lives in brain mansions built of words means that we lack the
6504	objectivity necessary to see the terrible distortion of reality which
6505	language brings. Example: the Chinese pictogram for 'integrity' is a
6506	two-part symbol of a man literally standing next to his word. So far,
6507	so good. But what does the Late English word 'honesty' mean? Or
6508	'Motherland'? Or 'progress'7 Or 'democracy'?
6509	Or 'beauty'? But even in our self-deception, we become gods.
6510	A philosopher/mathematician named Bertrand Russell, who lived and died
6511	in the same century as Gass, once wrote: 'Language serves not only to
6512	express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist
6513	without it." Here is the essence of mankind's creative genius: not the
6514	edifices of civiliz.tion nor the bang-flash weapons which can end it,
6515	but the words which fertilize new concepts like spermatazoa attacking an
6516	ovum. It might be argued that the Siamese-twin infants of word/idea are
6517	the only contribution the human species can, will, or should make to the
6518	reveling cosmos.
6519	(Yes, our DNA is unique but so is a salamander's. Yes, we construct
6520	artifacts but so have species ranging from beavers to the architect ants
6521	whose crenellated towers are visible right now off the port bow. Yes,
6522	we weave real-fabric things from the dreamstuff of mathematics, but the
6523	universe is hardwired with arithmetic. Scratch a circle and :r peeps
6524	out. Enter a new solar system and Tycho Brahe's formulae lie waiting
6525	under the black velvet cloak of space/time. But where has the universe
6526	hidden a word
6527	under its outer layer of biology, geometry, or insensate rock?) Even the
6528	traces of other intelligent life we have found - the blimps on Jove II,
6529	the Labyrinth Builders, the Seneschai empaths on Hebron, the Stick
6530	People of Durulis, the architects of the Time Tombs, the Shrike itself -
6531	have left us mysteries and obscure artifacts but no language. No words.
6532	The poet John Keats once wrote to a friend of his named Bailey: 'I am
6533	certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the
6534	truth of Imagination - What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be
6535	truth - whether it existed before or not."
6536	The Chinese poet George Wu, who died in the Last Sino-Japanese War about
6537	three centuries before the Hegira, understood this when he recorded on
6538	his comlog: 'Poets are the mad midwives to reality. They see not what
6539	is, nor what can be, but what must become." Later, on his last disk to
6540	his lover the week before he died, Wu said: 'Words are the only bullets
6541	in truth's bandolier. And poets are the snipers."
6542	You see, in the beginning was the Word. And the Word was made flesh in
6543	the weave of the human universe.
6544	And only the poet can expand this universe, finding shortcuts to new
6545	realities the way the Hawking drive tunnels under the barriers of
6546	Einsteinian space/time.
6547	To be a poet, I realized, a true poet, was to become the Avatar of
6548	humanity incarnate; to accept the mantle of poet is to carry the cross
6549	of the Son of Man, to suffer the birth pangs of the Soul-Mother of
6550	Humanity.
6551	To be a true poet is to become God.
6552	I tried to explain this to my friends on Heaven's Gate.
6553	'Piss, shit,' I said. 'Asshole motherfucker, goddamn shit goddamn.
6554	Cunt. Peepee cunt. Goddamn!'
6555	They shook their heads and smiled, and walked away.
6556	Great poets are rarely understood in their own day.
6557	The yellow-brown clouds rained acid on me. I waded in mud up to my
6558	thighs and cleaned leechweed from the city sewer pipes. Old Sludge died
6559	during my second year there when we were all working on a project
6560	extending the First Avenue Canal to the Midsump Mudflats. An
6561	accident. He was climbing a slime dune to rescue a single sulfur-rose
6562	from the advancing grouter when there was a mudquake. Kiti married
6563	shortly after that. She still worked part time as a crib doxy, but I
6564	saw less and less of her. She died in childbirth shortly after the
6565	green tsunami carried away Mudflat City. I continued to write poetry.
6566	How is it, you might ask, that someone can write fine verse with a
6567	vocabulary of only nine right-hemisphere words?
6568	The answer is that I used no words at all. Poetry is only secondarily
6569	about words. Primarily, it is about tuth. I dealt with the Ding an
6570	$i¢h, the substance behind the shadow, weaving powerful concepts,
6571	similes, and connections the way an engineer would raise a skyscraper
6572	with the whiskered-alloy skeleton being constructed long before the
6573	glass and plastic and chromaluminum appears.
6574	And slowly the words returned. The brain retrains and retools itself
6575	amazingly well. What had been lost in the left hemisphere found a home
6576	elsewhere or reasserted their primacy in the damaged regions like
6577	pioneers returning to a fire-damaged plain made more fertile by the
6578	flames. Where before a simple word like 'salt' would leave me
6579	stuttering and. gasping, my mind probing emptiness like a tongue
6580	prodding the socket of a missing tooth, now the words and phrases flowed
6581	back slowly, like the names of forgotten playmates. During the day I
6582	labored in the slimefields, but at night I sat at my splintered table
6583	and wrote my Cantos by the light of a hissing ghee lamp. Mark Twain
6584	once opined in his homey way: 'The difference between the right word and
6585	the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the
6586	lightning bug." He was droll but incomplete.
6587	During those long months of beginning my Cantos on Heaven's Gate, I
6588	discovered that the difference between finding the right word as opposed
6589	to accepting the almost right word was the difference between being
6590	struck by lightning and merely watching a lightning display.
6591	So my Cantos began and grew. Written on the flimsy sheets of recycled
6592	leechweed fiber which they issued by
6593	the ton for use as toilet paper, scribbled by one of the cheap felt-tip
6594	pens sold at the Company Store, the Cantos took shape. As the words
6595	returned, slipping into place like once scattered pieces of a 3-D
6596	pu:,le, I needed a form. Returning to don Baithazar's teachings, I
6597	tried on the measured nobility of Milton's epic verse. Gaining
6598	confidence, I added the romantic sensuality of a Byron matured by a
6599	Keatsish celebration of the language. Stirring all this, I seasoned the
6600	mixture with a dash of Yeats's brilliant cynicism and a pinch of Pound's
6601	obscure, scholastic arrogance. I chopped, diced, and added such
6602	ingredients as Eliot's control of imagery, Dylan Thomas's feel for
6603	place, Delmore Schwartz's sense of doom, Steve Tem's touch of horror,
6604	Salmud Brevy's plea for innocence; Daton's love of the convoluted rhyme
6605	scheme, Wu's worship of the physical, and Edmond Ki Fererra's radical
6606	playfulness.
6607	In the end, of course, I threw this entire mixture out and wrote the
6608	Cantos in a style all my own.
6609	If it had not been for Unk the slumyard bully, I probably still would be
6610	on Heaven's Gate, digging acid canals by day and writing Cantos by
6611	night.
6612	It was my day off and I was carrying my Cantos - the only copy of my
6613	manuscript! - to the Company Library in the Common Hall to do some
6614	research when Unk and two of his cronies appeared from an alley and
6615	demanded immediate payment of the next month's protection money. We had
6616	no universal cards in the Heaven's Gate Atmospheric Protectorate; we
6617	paid our debts in company scrip or bootleg marks. I had neither. Unk
6618	demanded to see what was in my plastic shoulder bag.
6619	Without thinking, I refused. It was a mistake. If I'd shown Unk the
6620	manuscript, he most probably would have scattered it in the mud and
6621	slapped me around after making threats. As it was, my refusal angered
6622	him so he and his two Neanderthal companions tore open the bag,
6623	scattered the manuscript in the mud, and beat me within the proverbial
6624	inch of my life.
6625	It so happened that on this day an EMV belonging to a Protectorate air
6626	quality control manager was passing
6627	low above and the wife of the manager, traveling alone to the arc's
6628	Company Residential Store, ordered the EMV down, had her android servant
6629	retrieve me and what was left of my Cantos, and then personally drove me
6630	to the Company Hospital. Normally, the members of the bonded work force
6631	received medical aid, if any, at the walk-in Bio Clinic, but the
6632	hospital did not want to refuse the wife of a manager so I was admitted
6633	- still unconscious - and watched over by a human doctor and the
6634	manager's wife while I recovered in a healing tank.
6635	All right, to make a banal long story into a banal short story, I'll cut
6636	to the uplink. Helenda - that was the manager's wife - read my
6637	manuscript while I was floating in renewal nutrient. She liked it. On
6638	the same day I was being decanted in the Company Hospital, Helenda
6639	farcast to Renaissance where she showed my Cantos to her sister Felia,
6640	who had a friend whose lover knew an editor at Transline Publishing.
6641	When I awoke the next day, my broken ribs had been set, my shattered
6642	cheekbone had been healed, my bruises were gone, and I'd received five
6643	new teeth, a new cornea for my left eye, and a contract with Transline.
6644	My book came out five weeks later. A week after that, Helenda divorced
6645	her manager and married me. It was her seventh marriage, my first. We
6646	honeymooned on the Concourse and, when we returned a month later, my
6647	book had sold more than a billion copies - the first book of verse to
6648	hit the bestseller lists in four centuries - and I was a millionaire
6649	many times over.
6650	Tyrena Wingreen-Feif was my first editor at Transline. It was her idea
6651	to title the book The Dying Earth (a records search showed a novel by
6652	that name five hundred years earlier, but the copyright had lapsed and
6653	the book was out of print). It was her idea to publish just the
6654	sections of the Cantos which dealt with the nostalgic final days of Old
6655	Earth. And it was her idea to remove the sections which she thought
6656	would bore the readers - the philosophical passages, the descriptions of
6657	my mother, the sections which paid homage to earlier poets, the places
6658	where I played with experimental verse, the more personal
6659	passages - everything, in fact, except the descriptions of the idyllic
6660	final days which, emptied of all heavier freight, came across as
6661	sentimental and insipid. Four months after publication The Dying Earth
6662	had sold two and a half billion hardfax copies, an abridged and
6663	digitalized version was available on the See Thing datasphere, and it
6664	had been optioned for the holies.
6665	Tyrena pointed out that the timing had been perfect...
6666	that the original trauma shock of the death of Old Earth had meant a
6667	century of denial, almost as if Earth had never existed, followed by a
6668	period of revived interest culminating in the Old Earth nostalgia cults
6669	which could now be found on every world in the Web. A book - even a
6670	book of verse - dealing with the final days had struck at precisely the
6671	right moment.
6672	For me, the first few months of life as a celebrity in the Hegemony were
6673	far more disorienting than my earlier transition from spoiled son of Old
6674	Earth to enslaved stroke victim on Heaven's Gate. During those first
6675	months I did book and fax signing on more than a hundred worlds; I
6676	appeared on 'The AllNet Now!" show with Marmon Hamlit; I met CEO
6677	Senister Per6t and All Thing Speaker Drury Fein aswell as a score of
6678	senators; I spoke to the Interplanetary Society of PEN Women and to the
6679	Lusus Writers' Union; I was given honorary degrees at the University of
6680	New Earth and at Cambridge Two; I was feted, interviewed, imaged,
6681	reviewed (favorably), bioed (unauthorized), lionized, serialized, and
6682	swindled. It was a busy time.
6683	Notes for a sketch of life in the Hegemony:
6684	My home has thirty-eight rooms on thirty-six worlds.
6685	No doors: the arched entrances are farcaster portals, a few opaqued with
6686	privacy curtains, most open to observation and entry. Each room has
6687	windows everywhere and at least two walls with portals. From the grand
6688	dining hall on Renaissance Vector, I can see the bronze skies and the
6689	verdigris towers of Keep Enable in the valley below my volcanic peak,
6690	and by turning my head I can look through the farcaster portal and
6691	across the expense of white carpet in the formal living area to see
6692	the Edgar Allan Sea crash against the spires of Point Prospero on
6693	Nevermore. My library looks out on the glaciers and green skies of
6694	Nordholm while a walk of ten paces allows me to descend a short stairway
6695	to my tower study, a comfortable, open room encircled by polarized glass
6696	which offers a three-hundred-sixty-degree view of the highest peaks of
6697	the Kushpat Karakoram, a mountain range two thousand kilometers from the
6698	nearest settlement in the easternmost reaches of the Jamnu Republic on
6699	Deneb Drei.
6700	The huge sleeping room Helenda and I share rocks gently in the boughs of
6701	a three-hundred-meter Worldtree on the Templar world of God's Grove and
6702	connects to a solarium which sits alone on the arid saltflats of Hebron.
6703	Not all of our views are of wilderness: the media room opens to a
6704	skimmer pad on the hundred and thirty-eighth floor of a Tau Ceti Center
6705	arctower and our patio lies on a terrace overlooking the market in the
6706	Old Section of bustling New Jerusalem. The architect, a student of the
6707	legendary Millon DeHaVre, has incorporated several small jokes into the
6708	house's design: the steps go down to the tower room, of course, but
6709	equally droll is the exit from the eyrie which leads to the exercise
6710	room on the lowest level of Lusus's deepest Hive, or perhaps the guest
6711	bathroom which consists of toilet, bidet, sink and shower stall on an
6712	open, wall-less raft afloat on the violet seaworld of Mare Infinitus.
6713	At qst the shifts in gravity from room to room were disturbing, out I
6714	soon adapted, subconsciously bracing myself for the drag of Lusus and
6715	Hebron and Sol Draconi Septera, unconsciously anticipating the less than
6716	l-stanclra-g freedom of the majority of the rooms.
6717	In the te ,,t nclard months Helenda and I are together we spend little
6718	6--. in our home, preferring instead to move with frcids ,,nong the
6719	resorts and vacation arcologies and night spots of the Worldweb. Our
6720	'friends' are the former farcaster set, now calling themselves the
6721	Caribou Herd after an extinct, Old Earth migratory mammal. This herd
6722	consists of other writers, a few successful visual artists, Concourse
6723	intellectuals, All Thing media representatives, a few radical ARNists
6724	and cosmetic gene splicers, Web aristocrats, wealthy farcaster freaks
6725	and Flashback addicts, a few holie and stage directors, a scattering of
6726	actors and performance artists, several Mafia dons gone straight, and a
6727	revolving list of recent celebrities... myself included.
6728	Everyone drinks, uses stims and autoimplants, takes the wire, and can
6729	afford the best drugs. The drug of choice is Flashback. It is
6730	definitely an upper-class vice: one needs the full range of expensive
6731	implants to fully experience it.
6732	Helenda has seen to it that I have been so fitted: biomonitors, sensory
6733	extenders, and internal comlog, neural shunts, kickers, metacortex
6734	processors, blood chips, RNA tapeworms . . . my mother wouldn't have
6735	recognized my insides.
6736	I try Flashback twice. The first time is a glide - I target my ninth
6737	birthday party and hit it with the first salvo. It is all there: the
6738	servants singing on the north lawn at daybreak, don Balthazar grudgingly
6739	canceling classes so I can spend the day with Amalfi in my EMV,
6740	streaking across the gray dunes of the Amazon Basin in gay abandon; the
6741	torchlight procession that evening as representatives of the other Old
6742	Families arrive at dusk, their brightly wrapped presents gleaming under
6743	the moon and the Ten Thousand Lights. I rise from nine hours in
6744	Flashback with a smile on my face. The second trip almost kills me.
6745	I am four and crying, seeking my mother through endless rooms smelling
6746	of dust and old furniture. Android servants seek to console me but I
6747	shake off their hands, running down hallways soiled with shadows and the
6748	soot of too many generations. Breaking the first rule I ever learned, I
6749	throw open the doors to Mother's sewing room, her sanctum sanctorum-to
6750	which she retires for three hours every afternoon and from which she
6751	emerges with her soft smile, the hem of her pale dress whispering across
6752	the carpet like the echo of a ghost's sigh.
6753	Mother is sitting there in the shadows. ! am four and my finger has
6754	been hurt and I rush to her, throwing myself into her arms.
6755	She does not respond. One of her elegant arms remains reclined along
6756	the back of the chaise !ongue, the other remains limp on the cushion.
6757	I pull back, shocked by her cool plasticity. I tug open the heavy
6758	velvet drapes without rising from her lap.
6759	Mother's eyes are white, rolled back in her head. Her lips are slightly
6760	open. Drool moistens the corners of her mouth and glints on her perfect
6761	chin. From the gold threads of her hair - done up in the Grande Dame
6762	style she favors - I see the cold steel gleam of the stim wire and the
6763	duller sheen of the skull socket she has plugged it into. The patch of
6764	bone on either side is very white. On the table near her left hand lies
6765	the empty Flashback syringe.
6766	The servants arrive and pull me away. Mother never blinks. I am pulled
6767	screaming from the room.
6768	I wake screaming.
6769	Perhaps it was my refusal to use Flashback again which hastened
6770	Helenda's departure, but I doubt it. I was a toy to her - a primitive
6771	who amused her by my innocence about a life she had taken for granted
6772	for many decades.
6773	Whatever the case, my refusal to Flashback left me with many days
6774	without her; the time spent in replay is real time and Flashback users
6775	often die having spent more days of their lives under the drug than they
6776	ever experienced conscious.
6777	At first I entertained myself with the implants and technotoys which had
6778	been denied to me as a member of an Old Earth Family. The datasphere
6779	was a constant delight that first year - I called up information almost
6780	continually, living in a frenzy of full interface. I was as addicted to
6781	raw data as the Caribou Herd were to their stims and drugs. I could
6782	imagine don Balthazar spinning in his molten grave as I gave up
6783	long-term memory for the transient satisfaction of implant omniscience.
6784	It was only later that I felt the loss- Fitzgerald's Odyssey, Wu's
6785	FinalMarch, and a score of other epics which had survived my stroke now
6786	were shredded like cloud fragments in a high wind. Much later, freed of
6787	implants, I painstakingly learned them all again.
6788	For the first and only time in my life I became political.
6789	Days and nights would pass with me monitoring the Senate on farcaster
6790	cable or lying tapped into the All Thing. Someone once estimated that
6791	the All Thing deals with about a hundred active pieces of Hegemony
6792	legislation per day, and during my months spent screwed into the
6793	sensorium I missed none of them. My voice and name became well known on
6794	the debate channels. No bill was too small, no issue too simple or too
6795	complex for my input. The simple act of voting every few minutes gave
6796	me a false sense of having accomplished something. I finally gave up
6797	the political obsession only after I realized that accessing the All
6798	Thing regularly meant either staying home or turning into a walking
6799	zombie. A person constantly busy accessing on his implants makes a
6800	pitiful sight in public and it didn't take Helenda's derision to make me
6801	realize that if I stayed home I would turn into an All Thing sponge like
6802	so many millions of other slugs around the Web. So I gave up politics.
6803	But by then I had found a new passion: religion.
6804	I joined religions. Hell, I helped create religions. The Zen Gnostic
6805	Church was expanding exponentially and I became a true believer,
6806	appearing on HTV talk shows and searching for my Places of Power with
6807	all of the devoutness of a pre-Hegira Muslim pilgrimaging to Mecca.
6808	Besides, I loved farcasting. I had earned almost a hundred million
6809	marks from royalties for The Dying Earth, and Helenda had invested well,
6810	but someone once figured that a farcaster home such as mine cost more
6811	than fifty thousand marks a day just to keep in the Web and I did not
6812	limit my farcasting to the thirty-six worlds of my home. Transline
6813	Publishing had qualified me for a gold universal card and I used it
6814	liberally, farcasting to unlikely corners of the Web and then spending
6815	weeks staying in luxury accommodations and leasing EMVs to find my
6816	Places of Power in remote areas of backwater worlds.
6817	I found none. I renounced Zen Gnosticism about the same time Helenda
6818	divorced me. By that time the bills were piling up and I had to
6819	liquidate most of the stocks and long-term investments remaining to me
6820	after Helenda had taken her share. (I was not only naive and in love
6821	when she had had her attorneys draw up the marriage contract... I was
6822	stupid.)
6823	Eventually, even with such economies as cutting down my farcasting and
6824	dismissing the android servants, I was facing financial disaster.
6825	I went to see Tyrena Wingreen-Feif.
6826	'No one wants to read poetry,' she said, leafing through the thin stack
6827	of Cantos I had written in the past year and a half.
6828	'What do you mean?" I said. 'The Dying Earth was poetry:'
6829	'The Dying Earth was a fluke,' said Tyrena. Her nails were long and
6830	green and curved in the latest mandarin fashion; they curled around my
6831	manuscript like the claws of some chlorophyll beast. 'It sold because
6832	the mass subconscious was ready for it."
6833	'Maybe the mass subconscious is ready for this,' I said. I was
6834	beginning to get angry.
6835	Tyrena laughed. It was not an altogether pleasant sound. 'Martin,
6836	Martin, Martin,' she said. 'This is poetry. You're writing about
6837	Heaven's Gate and the Caribou Herd, but what comes across is loneliness,
6838	displacement, angst, and a cynical look at humanity." 'So?"
6839	'So no one wants topay for a look at another person's angst,' laughed
6840	Tyrena.
6841	I turned away from her desk and walked to the far side of the room. Her
6842	office took up the entire four hundred and thirty-fifth floor of the
6843	Transline Spire in the Babel section of Tau Ceti Center. There were no
6844	windows; the circular room was open from floor to ceiling, shielded by a
6845	solar-generated containment field which showed no shimmer whatsoever. It
6846	was like standing between two gray plates suspended halfway between the
6847	sky and earth. I watched crimson clouds move between the lesser spires
6848	half a kilometer below and I thought about hubris.
6849	Tyrena's office had no doorways, stairways, elevators, field lifts, or
6850	trapdoors: no connection to the other levels at all. One entered
6851	Tyrena's office through the five-faceted farcaster which shimmered in
6852	midair like an abstract hoiosculpture. I found myself thinking about
6853	tower fires and power failures as well as hubris. I said,
6854	'Are you saying that you won't publish it?"
6855	'Not at all,' smiled my editor. 'You've earned Transline several
6856	billion marks, Martin. We will publish it. All I am saying is that no
6857	one will buy it."
6858	'You're wrong!" I shouted. 'Not everyone recognizes fine poetry, but
6859	there are still enough people who read to make it a bestseller."
6860	Tyrena did not laugh again but her smile slashed upward in a twist of
6861	green lips. 'Martin, Martin, Martin,' she said, 'the population of
6862	literate people has been declining steadily since Gutenberg's day. By
6863	the twentieth century, less than two percent of the people in the
6864	so-called industrialized democracies read even one book a year. And
6865	that was before the smart machines, dataspheres, and user-friendly
6866	environments. By the Hegira, ninety-eight percent of the Hegemony's
6867	population had no reason to read anything. So they didn't bother
6868	learning how to. It's worse t$day. There are more than a hundred
6869	billion human beings in the Worldweb and less than one percent of them
6870	bothers to hardfax any printed material, much less read a book."
6871	'The Dying Earth sold almost three billion copies,' I reminded her.
6872	'Mm-hmm,' said Tyrena. 'It was the Pilgrim's Progress Effect."
6873	'The what?"
6874	'Pilgrim's Progress Effect. In the Massachusetts Colony of... what was
6875	it! - seventeenth-century Old Earth, every decent family had to have a
6876	copy in the household. But, my heavens, no one had to read it. It was
6877	the same with Hitler's Mein Kampfor Stukatsky's
6878	Visions in the Eye of a Decapitated Child."
6879	'Who was Hitler?" I said.
6880	Tyrena smiled slightly. 'An Old Earth politician who did some writing.
6881	Mein Kampf is still in print ...
6882	Transline renews the copyright every hundred and thirty-eight years."
6883	'Well, look,' I said, 'I'm going to take a few weeks to polish up the
6884	Cantos and give it my best shot."
6885	'Fine,' smiled Tyrena.
6886	'I suppose you'll want to edit it the way you did last time?"
6887	'Not at all,' said Tyrena. 'Since there's no core of nostalgia this
6888	time, you might as well write it the way you want."
6889	I blinked. 'You mean I can keep in the blank verse this time?"
6890	'Of course."
6891	'And the philosophy?"
6892	'Please do."
6893	'And the experimental sections?"
6894	'Yes."
6895	'And you'll print it the way I write it?"
6896	'Absolutely."
6897	'Is there a chance it'll sell?"
6898	'Not a hope in hell."
6899	My 'few weeks to polish up the Cantos' turned into ten months of
6900	obsessive labor. I shut off most of the rooms in the house, keeping
6901	only the tower room on Deneb Drei, the exercise room on Lusus, the
6902	kitchen, and the bathroom raft on Mare lnfinitus. I worked a straight
6903	ten hours a day, took a break for some vigorous exercise followed by a
6904	meal and a nap, and then returned to my writing table for another
6905	eight-hour stint. It was similar to the time five years before when I
6906	was recovering from my stroke and it sometimes took an hour or a day for
6907	a word to come to me, for a concept to sink its roots into the firm soil
6908	of language. Now it was an even slower process as I agonized over the
6909	perfect word, the precise rhyme scheme, the most playful image, and the
6910	most ineffable analog to the most elusive emotion.
6911	After ten standard months I was done, acknowledging the ancient aphorism
6912	to the effect that no book or poem is ever finished, merely abandoned.
6913	'What do you think?" I asked Tyrena as she read through the first copy.
6914	Her eyes were blank, bronze disks in that week's fashion, but this did
6915	not hide the fact that there were tears there. She brushed one away.
6916	'It's beautiful,' she said.
6917	'I tried to discover the voice of some of the Ancients,' I said,
6918	suddenly shy.
6919	'You succeeded brilliantly."
6920	'The Heaven's Gate Interlude is still rough,' I said.
6921	'It's perfect."
6922	'It's about loneliness,' I said.
6923	'It is loneliness."
6924	'Do you think it's ready?" I asked.
6925	'It's perfect... a masterpiece." 'Do you think it'll sell?" I asked.
6926	'No fucking way."
6927	They planned an initial run of seventy million hardfax copies of Cantos.
6928	Transline ran ads throughout the datasphere, placed HTV commercials,
6929	transmitted software inserts, successfully solicited blurbs from
6930	best-selling authors, made sure it was reviewed in the New New York
6931	Times Book Section and the TC Review, and generally spent a fortune on
6932	advertising.
6933	The Cantos sold twenty-three thousand hardfax copies during the first
6934	year it was in print. At ten percent royalties of the I2MK cover price,
6935	I had earned back I3,800MK of my 2,000,000MK advance from Transline.
6936	The second year saw a sale of 638 hardfax copies; there were no
6937	datasphere rights sold, no holie options, and no book tours.
6938	What the Cantos lacked in sales it made up for in negative reviews:
6939	'Indecipherable... archaic... irrelevant to all current concerns,'
6940	said the Times Book Section. 'M. Silenus has committed the ultimate
6941	act of non-communication,' wrote Urban Kapry in the TC'v Review, 'by
6942	indulging himself in an orgy of pretentious obfuscation." Marmon Hamlit
6943	on 'AllNet Now!" issued the final deathblow: 'Oh, the poetry thing from
6944	Whatshisname - couldn't read it. Didn't try."
6945	Tyrena Wingreen-Fef did not seem concerned. Two weeks after the first
6946	reviews and hardfax returns came in, a day after my thirteen-day binge
6947	ended, I farcast to her office and threw myself into the black flowfoam
6948	chair which crouched in the center of the room like a velvet
6949	panther. One of Tau Ceti Center's legendary thunderstorms was going on
6950	and Jovian-sized lightning crashes were rending the blood-tinged air
6951	just beyond the invisible containment field.
6952	'Don't sweat it,' said Tyrena. This week's fashions included a hairdo
6953	which sent black spikes thrusting half a meter above her forehead and a
6954	body field opaciter which left shifting currents of color concealing -
6955	and revealing- the nudity beneath. 'The first run only amounted to
6956	sixty thousand fax transmits so we're not out much there."
6957	'You said seventy million were planned,' I said.
6958	'Yeah, well, we changed our minds after Transline's resident AI read
6959	it."
6960	I slumped lower in the flowfoam. 'Even the AI hated it?"
6961	'The AI loved it,' said Tyrena. 'That's when we knew for sure that
6962	people were going to hate it."
6963	I sat up. 'Couldn't we have sold copies to the TechnoCore?"
6964	'We did,' said Tyrena. 'One. The millions of Als there probably
6965	real-time-shared it the minute it came in over fatline. Interstellar
6966	copyright doesn't mean shit when you're dealing with silicon."
6967	'All right,' I said, slumping. 'What next?" Outside, lightning bolts
6968	the size of Old Earth's ancient super-highways danced between the
6969	corporate spires and cloud towers.
6970	Tyrena rose from her desk and walked to the edge of the carpeted circle.
6971	Her body field flickered like electrically charged oil on water. 'Next,'
6972	she said, 'you decide if you want to be a writer or the Worldweb's
6973	biggest jerk-off."
6974	'What?"
6975	'You heard me." Tyrena turned and smiled. Her teeth had been capped to
6976	gold points. 'The contract allows us to recover the advance in any way
6977	we have to. Seizing your assets at Interbank, recovering the gold coins
6978	you've got hidden on Homefree, and selling that gaudy farcaster house
6979	would about do it. And then you can go join the other artistic
6980	dilettantes and dropouts and
6981	mental cases that Sad King Billy collects on whatever
6982	Outback world he lives on."
6983	I stared.
6984	'Then again,' she said and smiled her cannibal smile, 'we can just
6985	forget this temporary setback and you can get to work on your next
6986	book."
6987	My next book appeared five standard months later. The Dying Earth H
6988	picked up where The Dying Earth left off, in plain prose this time, the
6989	sentence length and chapter content carefully guided by
6990	neuro-bio-monitored responses on a test group of 638 average hard fax
6991	readers.
6992	The book was in novel form, short enough not to intimidate the potential
6993	buyer at Food Mart checkout stands, and the cover was a twenty-second
6994	interactive holo wherein the tall, swarthy stranger - Amalfi Schwartz, I
6995	suppose, although Amalfi was short and pale and wore corrective lenses-
6996	rips the bodice of the struggling female just to the nipple line before
6997	the protesting blonde turns toward the viewer and cries for help in a
6998	breathless
6999	whisper provided by porn holie star Leeda Swann.
7000	Dying Earth H sold nineteen million copies.
7001	'Not bad,' said Tyrena. 'It takes awhile to build an audience."
7002	'The first Dying Earth sold three billion copies,' I said.
7003	'Pilgrim's Progress,' she said. 'Mein Kampf. Once in a century. Maybe
7004	less."
7005	'But it sold three billion..."
7006	'Look,' said Tyrena. 'In twentieth-century Old Earth, a fast food chain
7007	took dead cow meat, fried it in grease, added carcinogens, wrapped it in
7008	petroleum-based foam, and sold nine hundred billion units. Human
7009	beings. Go figure."
7010	Dying Earth III introduced the characters of Winona, the escaped slave
7011	girl who rose to the ownership of her own fiberplastic plantation (never
7012	mind that fiberplastic never grew on Old Earth), Arturo Redgrave, the
7013	dashing blockade runner (what blockade?!), and Innocence Sperry, the
7014	nine-year-old telepath dying of an unspecified Little Nell disease.
7015	Innocence lasted until
7016	Dying Earth IX, and on the day Transline allowed mc to kill the little
7017	shit off, I went out to celebrate with a six-day, ',wenty-world binge. I
7018	awoke in a lungpipe on Hcaven's Gate, covered with vomit and rebreatber
7019	mold, nursing the Wcb's biggest beadache and the sure knowledge that I
7020	soon would have to start on Volume X of The Chronicles of the Dying
7021	Earth.
7022	It isn't hard being a hack writer. Between Dying Earth H and Dying
7023	Earth IX, six standard years had passed relatively painlessly. My
7024	research was meager, my plots for-mulaic, my characters cardboard, my
7025	prose preliterate, and my free time was my own. I traveled. I married
7026	twice more; each wife left me with no hard feelings but with a sizable
7027	portion of the royalties from my next Dying Earth. I explored religions
7028	and serious drinking, finding more hope of lasting solace in the latter.
7029	I kept my home, adding six rooms on five worlds, and filled it with fine
7030	art. I entertained. Writers were among my acquaintances but, as in all
7031	times, we tended to mistrust and badmouth each other, secretly resenting
7032	the other's successes and finding fault in their work. Each of us knew
7033	in his or her heart that he or she was a true artist of the word who
7034	merely happened to be commercial; the others were hacks.
7035	Then, on a cool morning with my sleeping room rocking slightly in the
7036	upper branches of my tree on the Templar world, I awoke to a gray sky
7037	and the realization that my muse had fled.
7038	It had been five years since I had written any poetry.
7039	The Cantos lay open in the Deneb Drei tower, only a few pages finished
7040	beyond what had been published. I had been using thought processors to
7041	write my novels and one of these activated as I entered the study. SHIT,
7042	it printed out, WHAT DID i DO WITH MY MUSE?
7043	It says something about the type of writing I had been doing that my
7044	muse could flee without my noticing. For those who do not write and who
7045	never have been stirred by the creative urge, talk of muses seems a
7046	figure of speech, a quaint conceit, but for those of us who live by the
7047	Word, our muses are as real and necessary as the soft
7048	clay of language which they help to sculpt. When one is writing -
7049	really writing - it is as if one is given a fatlinc to tbe gods. No
7050	true poet has been able to explain the exhilaration one feels when the
7051	mind becomes an instrument as surely as does the pen or thought
7052	processor, ordering and expressing the revelations flowing in from
7053	somewhere else.
7054	My muse had fled. I sought her in the other worlds of my house but only
7055	silence echoed back from the art-bedecked walls and empty spaces. I
7056	farcast and flew to my favorite places, watching the suns set on the
7057	windblown prairies of Grass and the night fogs obscure the ebony crags
7058	of Nevermore, but although I emptied my mind of tbe trash-prose of the
7059	endless Dying Earth, there came no whispers from my muse.
7060	I sought her in alcohol and Flashback, returning to the productive days
7061	on Hcaven's Gate when her inspiration was a constant buzzing in my cars,
7062	interrupting my work, waking mc from sleep, but in the rclived hours and
7063	days her voice was as muted and garbled as a damaged audio disk from
7064	some forgotten century.
7065	My muse had fled.
7066	I farcast to Tyrena Wingreen-Feif's office at the precise moment of my
7067	appointment. Tyrena had been promoted from editor-in-chief of the
7068	hardfax division to publisher.
7069	Her new office occupied the highest level of the Tau Ceti Center
7070	Transline Spire and standing there was like perching on the carpeted
7071	summit of the galaxy's tallest, thinnest peak; only the invisible dome
7072	of the slightly polarized containment field arched overhead and the edge
7073	of the carpet ended in a six-kilometer drop. I wondered if other
7074	authors felt the urge to jump.
7075	'The new opus?" said Tyrena. Lusus was dominating the fashion universe
7076	this week and 'dominate' was the right word; my editor was dressed in
7077	leather and iron, rusted spikes on her wrists and neck and a massive
7078	ban-dolier across her shoulder and left breast. The cartridges looked
7079	real.
7080	'Yeah,' I said and tossed the manuscript box on her desk.
7081	'Martin, Martin, Martin,' she sighed, 'when are you going to transmit
7082	your books rather than going to all the trouble of printing them out and
7083	bringing them here in person?"
7084	'There's a strange satisfaction in delivering them,' I
7085	said. 'Especially this one."
7086	'Oh?"
7087	'Yes,' I said. 'Why don't you read some of it?" Tyrena smiled and
7088	clicked black fingernails along the cartridges in her bandolicr. 'I'm
7089	sure it's up to your usual high standards, Martin,' she said. 'I don't
7090	have to look at it."
7091	'Please do,' I said.
7092	'Really,' said Tyrcna, 'there's no reason. It always makes me nervous
7093	to read a new work while the author is present."
7094	· 'This one won't,' I said. 'Read just the first few pages."
7095	She must have heard something in my voice because she frowned slightly
7096	and opened the box. The frown deepened as she read the first page and
7097	flipped through the rest of the manuscript.
7098	Page one had a single sentence: 'And then, one fine morning in October,
7099	the Dying Earth swallowed its own bowels, spasmed its final spasm and
7100	died." The other two
7101	hundred and ninety-nine pages were blank.
7102	'A joke, Martin?".
7103	'Nope."
7104	'A subtle hint then? You would like to begin a new series?"
7105	'Nope."
7106	'It's not as if we hadn't expected it, Martin. Our story-liners have
7107	come up with several exciting series ideas for you. M. Subwaizee
7108	thinks that you would be perfect for the novelizations of the Crimson
7109	Avenger holies."
7110	'You can stick the Crimson Avenger up your corporate ass, Tyrena,' I
7111	said cordially. 'I'm finished with Transline and this premasticated
7112	gruel you call fiction."
7113	Tyrena's expression did not flicker. Her teeth were not pointed; today
7114	they were rusted iron to match the spikes on her wrists and the collar
7115	around her neck. 'Martin,
7116	Martin, Martin,' she sighed, 'you have no idea how finished you will be
7117	if you don't apologize, straighten up, and fly right. But that can wait
7118	until tomorrow. Why don't you step home, sober up, and think about
7119	this?"
7120	I laughed. 'I'm as sober as l've been in eight years, lady. It just
7121	took me awhile to realize that it wasn't just me who's writing crap...
7122	there's not a book published in the Web this year that hasn't been total
7123	garbage. Well, l'm getting off the scow."
7124	Tyrena rose. For the first time I noticed that on her simulated canvas
7125	web belt there hung a FORCE death-wand.
7126	I hoped that it was a designer-fake as the rest of her costume.
7127	'Listen, you miserable, no-talent hack,' she hissed.
7128	'Transline owns you from the balls up. If you give us any more trouble
7129	we'll have you working in the Gothic Romance factory under the name
7130	Rosemary Titmouse.
7131	Now go home, sober up, and get to work on Dying Earth X."
7132	I smiled and shook my head.
7133	Tyrena squinted slightly. 'You're still into us for almost a
7134	million-mark advance,' she said. 'One word to Collections and we'll
7135	seize every room of your house except that goddamn raft you use as an
7136	outhouse. You can sit on it until the oceans fill up with crap."
7137	I laughed a final time. 'It's a self-contained disposal unit,' I said.
7138	'Besides, I sold the house yesterday. The check for the balance of the
7139	advance should have been transmitted by now."
7140	Tyrena tapped the plastic grip of her deathwand.
7141	'Transline's copyrighted the Dying Earth concept, you
7142	know. We'll just have someone else write the books."
7143	I nodded. 'They're welcome to it."
7144	Something in my ex-editor's voice changed when she realized that I was
7145	serious. Somewhere, I sensed, there was an advantage to her if I
7146	stayed. 'Listen,' she said, 'l'm sure we can work this out, Martin. I
7147	was saying to the director the other day that your advances were too
7148	small and that Transline should let you develop a new story line..."
7149	'Tyrena, Tyrena, Tyrena,' I sighed. 'Goodbye."
7150	I farcast to Renaissance VectOr and then to Parsimony, where ! boarded
7151	a spinship for the three-week voyage to Asquith and the crowded kingdom
7152	of Sad King Billy.
7153	Notes for a sketch of Sad King Billy:
7154	His Royal Highness King William XXIII, sovereign lord of the Kingdom of
7155	Windsor-in-Exile, looks a bit like a wax candle of a man who has been
7156	left on a hot stove.
7157	His long hair runs in limp rivulets to slumped shoulders while the
7158	furrows on his brow trickle downward to the tributaries of wrinkles
7159	around the basset-hound eyes, and then run southward again through folds
7160	and frown lines to the maze of wattles in neck and jowls. King Billy is
7161	said to remind anthropologists of the worry dolls of the Outback
7162	Kinshasa, to make Zen Gnostics recall the Pitiful Buddha after the
7163	temple fire on Tai Zhin, and to send media historians rushing to their
7164	archives to check photos of an ancient flat-film movie actor named
7165	Charles Laughton. None of these references mean anything to me; I look
7166	at King Billy and think of my long-dead tutor don Balthazar after a
7167	week-long binge.
7168	Sad King Billy's reputation for gloominess is exaggerated.
7169	He often laughs; it is merely his misfortune that his peculiar form of
7170	laughter makes most people think he is sobbing.
7171	A man cannot help his physiognomy, but in His Highness's case, the
7172	entire persona tends to suggest either 'buffoon' or 'victim." He
7173	dresses, if that can be the word, in something approaching a constant
7174	state of anarchy, defying the taste and color sense of his android
7175	servants, so that on some days he clashes with himself and his
7176	environment simultaneously. Nor is his appearance limited to sartorial
7177	chaos - King William moves in a permanent sphere of dishabille, his fly
7178	unsealed, his velvet cape torn and tattered and drawing crumbs
7179	magnetically from the floor, his left sleeve ruffle twice as long as the
7180	right, which - in turn - looks as if it has been dipped in jam.
7181	You get the idea.
7182	For all this, Sad King Billy has an insightful mind and a passion for
7183	the arts and literature which has not been equaled since the true
7184	Renaissance days on old Old Earth.
7185	In some ways King Billy is the fat child with his face eternally pressed
7186	to the candy store window. He loves and appreciates fine music but
7187	cannot produce it. A connoisseur of ballet and all things graceful, His
7188	Highness is a klutz, a moving series of pratfalls and comic bits of
7189	clumsiness. A passionate reader, unerring poetry critic, and patron of
7190	forensics, King Billy combines a stutter in his verbal expression with a
7191	shyness which will not allow him to show his verse or prose to anyone
7192	else.
7193	A lifelong bachelor now entering his sixtieth year, King Billy inhabits
7194	the tumbledown palace and two-thousand-square-mile kingdom as if it were
7195	another suit of rumpled, royal clothes. Anecdotes abound: one of the
7196	famous oil painters whom King Billy supports finds His Majesty walking
7197	head down, hands clasped behind him, one foot on the garden path and one
7198	in the mud, obviously lost in thought. The artist hails his patron. Sad
7199	King Billy looks up, blinks, looks around as if awakening from a long
7200	nap. 'Excuse me,' His Highness says to the bemused painter, 'b-b-but
7201	could you p-p-please tell me - was I headed toward the palace or away
7202	from the p-p-palace?" 'Toward the palace, Your Majesty,' replies the
7203	artist. 'Oh, g-g-good,' sighs the King, 'then l've had lunch."
7204	General Horace Glennon-Height had begun his rebellion and the Outback
7205	world of Asquith lay directly in his path of conquest. Asquith was not
7206	- the Hegemony had offered a FORCE:space fleet as a shield - but
7207	the royal ruler of the Kingdom of Monaco-in-Exile seemed more melted
7208	than ever when he called me in.
7209	'Martin,' said His Majesty, 'you've h-h-heard about the b-battle for
7210	Fomalhaut?"
7211	'Yeah,' I said. 'It doesn't sound like anything to worry about.
7212	Fomalhaut was just the kind of place Glennon-Height's been hitting ...
7213	small, no more than a few thousand colonists, rich in minerals, and with
7214	a time-debt of at least - what was it? - twenty standard months from
7215	the Web."
7216	'Twenty-three,' said Sad King Billy. 'So you d-d-don't think that w-we
7217	are in d-d-d-jeopardy?"
7218	'Uh-uh,' I said. 'With only a three-week real-transit time and a
7219	time-debt of less than a year, the Hegemony can always get forces here
7220	from the Web faster than the General can spin up from Fomalhaut."
7221	'Perhaps,' mused King Billy, beginning to lean on a globe and then
7222	jumping upright as it started to turn under his weight. 'But
7223	none-the-the less I've decided to start our own m-m-modest Hegira."
7224	I blinked, surprised. Billy had been talking about relocating the
7225	kingdom in exile for almost two years, but I had never thought he would
7226	go through with it.
7227	'The sp-sp-sp... the ships are ready on Parvati,' he said. 'Asquith
7228	has agreed to su-su-su... to provide the transport we need to the Web."
7229	'But the palace?" I said. 'The library? The farms and grounds?"
7230	'Donated, of course,' said King Billy, 'but the contents of the library
7231	will travel with us."
7232	I sat on the arm of the horsehair divan and rubbed my cheek. In the ten
7233	years I had been in the kingdom, I had progressed from Billy's subject
7234	of patronage to tutor, to confidant, to friend, but never did I pretend
7235	to understand this disheveled enigma. Upon my arrival he had granted me
7236	an immediate audience. 'D-d-do you w-w-wish to j-j-join the other
7237	t-t-talented people in our little colony?" he had asked.
7238	'Yes, Your Majesty."
7239	'And w-w-will you wr-wr-write more books like the D-D-Dying Earth?"
7240	'Not if I can help it, Your Majesty."
7241	'i r-r-read it, you know,' the little man had said. 'It was v-v-very
7242	interesting."
7243	'You're most kind, Sir."
7244	'B-b-b-bullshit, M. Silenus. It w-w-was interesting because someone
7245	had obviously b-b-bowdlerized it and left in all the bad parts."
7246	I had grinned, surprised by the sudden revelation that I was going to
7247	like Sad King Billy.
7248	'B-b-but the Cantos,' he sighed, 'th-th-that was a
7249	book. Probably the finest volume of v-v... poetry published in the Web
7250	in the last two centuries. How you managed to get that by the
7251	mediocrity police I will never know. I ordered twenty thousand copies
7252	for the k-k-kingdom."
7253	I bowed my head slightly, at a loss for words for the
7254	first time since my poststroke days two decades before.
7255	'Will you write more p-p-poetry like the Cantos?" 'I came here to try,
7256	Your Majesty."
7257	'Then welcome,' said Sad King Billy. 'You will stay in the west wing of
7258	the p-p-p... castle, near my offices, and my door will always be open
7259	to you."
7260	Now I glanced at the closed door and at the little sovereign who - even
7261	when smiling - looked as if he were on the verge of tears. 'Hyperion?"
7262	I asked. He had mentioned the colony world-gone-primitive many times. ,
7263	'Precisely. The android seedships have been there for some years,
7264	M-M-Martin. Preparing the way, as it were."
7265	I raised an eyebrow. King Billy's wealth came not from the assets of
7266	the kingdom but from major investments in the Web economy. Even so, if
7267	he had been carrying on a surreptitious recolonization effort for years,
7268	the cost must have been staggering.
7269	'D-d-do you remember why the original colonists named the pluh-pluh-pluh
7270	... the world Hyperion, Martin?"
7271	'Sure. Before the Hegira they were a tiny freehold on one of the moons
7272	of Saturn. They couldn't last without terrestrial resupply, so they
7273	emigrated to the Outback and named the survey world after their moon."
7274	King Billy smiled sadly. 'And do you Inow why the name is
7275	p-p-propitious for our endeavor?"
7276	It took me about ten seconds to make the connection.
7277	'Keats,' I said.
7278	Several years earlier, near the end of a long discussion about the
7279	essence of poetry, King Billy had asked me who was the purest poet who
7280	had ever lived.
7281	'The purest?" I had said. 'Don't you mean the greatest ?"
7282	'No, no,' said Billy, 'that's absurd t-t-to argue over who is the
7283	greatest. i'm curious about your opinion of
7284	the p-p-purest... the closest to the essence you describe."
7285	I had thought about it a few days and then brought my answer to King
7286	Billy as we watched the setting suns from the top of the bluff near the
7287	palace. Red and blue shadows stretched across the amber lawn toward us.
7288	'Keats,' I said.
7289	'John Keats,' whispered Sad King Billy. 'Ahh." And then a moment later:
7290	'Why?"
7291	So I had told him what I knew about the nineteenth-century Old Earth
7292	poet; about his upbringing, training, and early death ... but mostly
7293	about a life dedicated almost totally to the mysteries and beauties of
7294	poetic creation.
7295	Billy had seemed interested then; he seemed obsessed now as he waved his
7296	hand and brought into existence a holo model which all but filled the
7297	room. I moved backward, stepping through hills and buildings and
7298	grazing animals to get a better view.
7299	'Behold Hyperion,' whispered my patron. As was usually the case when he
7300	was totally absorbed, King Billy forgot to stutter. The holo shifted
7301	through a series of views: river cities, port cities, mountain eyries, a
7302	city on a hill filled with monuments to match the strange buildings in a
7303	nearby valley.
7304	'The Time Tombs?" I said.
7305	'Precisely. The greatest mystery in the known universe."
7306	I frowned at the hyperbole. 'They're fucking empty,' I said. 'They've
7307	been empty since they were discovered."
7308	'They are the source of a strange, anti-entropic force-field which
7309	lingers still,' said King Billy. 'One of the few phenomena outside
7310	singularities which dares to tamper with time itself."
7311	'It's no big deal,' I said. 'It must've been like painting rust
7312	preventative on metal. They were made to last but they're empty. And
7313	since when do we go bugfuck about technology?"
7314	'Not technology,' sighed King Billy, his face melting into deeper
7315	grooves. 'Mystery. The strangeness of place so necessary to some
7316	creative spirits. A perfect mixture of the classical utopia and the
7317	pagan mystery."
7318	I shrugged, not impressed.
7319	Sad King Billy waved the hoio away. 'Has your p-p-poetry improved?"
7320	I crossed my arms and glared at the regal dwarf-slob.
7321	'No."
7322	'Has your m-m-muse returned?"
7323	I said nothing. If looks could have killed, we would all be crying 'The
7324	King is dead, long live the King!" before nightfall.
7325	'Very w-w-we!i,' he said, showing that he could look insufferably smug
7326	as well as sad. 'P-p-pack your bags, my boy. We're going to Hyperion."
7327	(Fade in)
7328	Sad King Billy's five seedships floating like golden dandelions above a
7329	lapis sky. White cities rising on three continents: Keats, Endymion,
7330	Port Romance ... the Poets' City itself. More than eight thousand of
7331	Art's pilgrims seeking escape from the tyranny of mediocrity and
7332	searching for a renewal of vision on this rough-hewn world.
7333	Asquith and Windsor-in-Exile had been a center for android biofacture in
7334	the century following the Hegira, and now these blueskinned
7335	friends-of-man labored and tilled with the understanding that once these
7336	final labors were finished they were free at last. The white cities
7337	rose.
7338	The indigenies, tired of playing native, came out' of their villages and
7339	forests and helped us rebuild the colony to more human specifications.
7340	The technocats and bureaucrats and ecocrats were thawed and let loose
7341	upon the unsuspecting world and Sad King Billy's dream came one step
7342	closer to reality.
7343	By the time we arrived at Hyperion, General Horace Glennon-Height was
7344	dead, his brief but brutal mutiny already crushed, but there was no
7345	turning back.
7346	Some of the more rugged artists and artisans spurned the Poets' City and
7347	eked out rugged but creative lives in Jacktown or Port Romance, or even
7348	in the expanding frontiers beyond, but I stayed.
7349	I found no muse on Hyperion during those first years.
7350	For many, the expansion of distance because of limited transportation -
7351	EMVs were unreliable, skimmers
7352	scarce - and the contraction of artificial consciousness due to absence
7353	of datasphere, no access to the All Thing, and only one fatline
7354	transmitter - all led to a renewal of creative energies, a new
7355	realization of what it meant to be
7356	human and an artist.
7357	Or so I heard.
7358	No muse appeared. My verse continued to be techni cally proficient and
7359	dead as Huck Finn's cat.
7360	I decided to kill myself.
7361	But first I spent some time, nine years at least, carrying out a
7362	community service by providing the one thing new Hyperion lacked:
7363	decadence.
7364	From a biosculptor aptly named Graumann Hacket, I obtained the hairy
7365	flanks, hooves, .and goat legs of a satyr. I cultivated my beard and
7366	extended my ears.
7367	Graumann made interesting alterations to my sexual apparatus. Word got
7368	around. Peasant girls, indigenies, the wives of our true-blue city
7369	planners and pioneers -all awaited a visit from Hyperion's only resident
7370	satyr or arranged one themselves. I learned what 'priapic' and
7371	'satyriasis' really mean. Besides the unending series of sexual
7372	contests, I allowed my drinking bouts to become legendary and my
7373	vocabulary to return to something approaching the old poststroke days·
7374	It was fucking wonderful. It was fucking hell.
7375	And then on the night I had set aside to blow my brains out, Grendel
7376	appeared.
7377	Notes for a sketch of our visiting monster:
7378	Our worst dreams have come alive. Something wicked shuns the light.
7379	Shades of Morbius and the Kre!l. Keep the fires high, Mother, Grendel
7380	comes tonight.
7381	At first we think the missing are merely absent; there are no watchers
7382	on the wails of our city, no walls actually, no warriors at the door of
7383	our mead hall. Then a husband reports a wife who disappears between the
7384	eve ning meal and the tucking in of their two children. Then Hoban
7385	Kristus, the abstract impiosionist, fails to appear at midweek
7386	performance at Poets' Amphitheatre, his first missed cue in eighty-two
7387	years of treading the boards. Concern rises. Sad King Billy returns
7388	from his labors as overseer on the .lacktown restoration and promises
7389	that security will be tightened. A sensor net is woven around the town.
7390	ShipSecurity officers sweep the Time Tombs and report that all remains
7391	empty. Mechs are sent into the labyrinth entrance at the base of the
7392	Jade Tomb and report nothing in a six-thousand-kilometer probe.
7393	Skimmers, automated and manned, sweep the area between the city and the
7394	Bridle Range and sense nothing larger than the heat signature of a rock
7395	eel.
7396	For a local week there are no more disappearances.
7397	Then the deaths begin.
7398	The sculptor Pete Garcia is found in his studio . . .
7399	and in his bedroom... and in the yard beyond. Ship-Security Manager
7400	Truin Hines is foolish enough to tell a newsteep: 'It's like he was
7401	mauled by some vicious animal.
7402	But no animal I've ever seen could do that to a man."
7403	We are all secretly thrilled and titillated. True, the dialogue is bad,
7404	straight out of a million movies and holies we've scared ourselves with,
7405	but now we are part of the show.
7406	Suspicion turns toward the obvious: a psychopath is loose among us,
7407	probably killing with a pulse-blade or hellwhip. This time he (or she)
7408	had not found time to dispose of the body. Poor Pete.
7409	ShipSecurity Manager Hines is sacked and City Manager Pruett receives
7410	permission from His Majesty to hire, train, and arm a city police force
7411	of approximately twenty officers. There is talk of truth-testing the
7412	entire Poets' City population of six thousand. Sidewalk cafes buzz with
7413	conversation on civil rights... we were technically out of the Hegemony
7414	- did we have any rights?
7415	. . and harebrained schemes are hatched to catch the murderer.
7416	Then the slaughter begins.
7417	There was no pattern to the murders. Bodies were found in twos and
7418	threes, or alone, or not at all. Some of the disappearances were
7419	bloodless; others left gallons of gore. There were no witnesses, no
7420	survivors of attacks.
7421	Location did not seem to matter: the Weimont family
7422	lived in one of the outlying villas but Sira Rob never stirred from her
7423	tower studio near the center of town; two of the victims disappeared
7424	alone, at night, apparently while walking in the Zen Garden, but
7425	Chancellor Lehman's daughter had private bodyguards yet vanished while
7426	alone in a bathroom on the seventh floor of Sad King Billy's palace.
7427	On Lusus or Tau Ceti Center or a dozen other of the old Web worlds, the
7428	deaths of a thousand people add up to minor news - items for datasphere
7429	short-term or the inside pages of the morning paper - but in a city of
7430	six thousand on a colony of fifty thousand, a dozen murders - like the
7431	proverbial sentence to be hanged in the morning- tend to focus one's
7432	attention wonderfully well.
7433	I knew one of the first victims. Sissipriss Harris had been one of my
7434	first conquests as a satyr - and one of my most enthusiastic - a
7435	beautiful girl, long blond hair too soft to be real, a
7436	fresh-picked-peach complexion too virginal to dream of touching, a
7437	beauty too perfect to believe: precisely the sort that even the most
7438	timid male dreams of violating, Sissipriss now had been violated in
7439	earnest. They found only her head, lying upright in the center of Lord
7440	Byron's Plaza as if she had been buried to her neck in pourable marble.
7441	I knew when I heard these details precisely what kind of creature we
7442	were dealing with, for a cat I had owned on Mother's estate had left
7443	similar offerings on the south patio most summer mornings - the head of
7444	a mouse staring up from the sandstone in pure rodent amazement, or
7445	perhaps a ground squirrel's toothy grin- killing trophies from a proud
7446	but hungry predator.
7447	Sad King Billy came to visit me while I was working on my Cantos.
7448	'Good morning, Billy,' I said.
7449	'It's Your Majesty,' grumped His Majesty in a rare show of royal pique.
7450	His stutter had disappeared the day the royal dropship landed on
7451	Hyperion.
7452	'Good morning, Billy, Your Majesty."
7453	'Hnnrh,' growled my liege lord, moving some papers
7454	and managing to sit in the only puddle of spilled coffee on an otherwise
7455	dry bench. 'You're writing again, Silenus."
7456	I saw no reason to acknowledge an acknowledgment of the obvious.
7457	'Have you always used a pen7'
7458	'No,' I said, 'only when I want to write something worth reading."
7459	'Is that worth reading?" He gestured toward the small heap of manuscript
7460	I had accrued in two local weeks of work.
7461	'Yes."
7462	'Yes? Just yes?"
7463	'Yes."
7464	'Will I get to read it soon?"
7465	'No."
7466	King Billy looked down and noticed that his leg was in a puddle of
7467	coffee. He frowned, moved, and mopped at the shrinking pool with the
7468	hem of his cape. 'Never?" he said.
7469	'Not unless you outlive me."
7470	'Which I plan to do,' said the King. 'While you expire
7471	from playing goat to the kingdom's ewes."
7472	'Is that an attempt at a metaphor?"
7473	'Not in the least,' said King Billy. 'Merely an observation. '
7474	'I haven't forced my attentions on a ewe since my boyhood days on the
7475	farm,' I said. 'I promised my mother in song that I wouldn't indulge in
7476	sheep fucking again without asking her permission." While King Billy
7477	looked on mournfully, I sang a few bars of an ancient ditty called
7478	'There'll Never Be Another Ewe."
7479	'Martin,' he said, 'someone or something is killing my people."
7480	I set aside my paper and pen. 'I know,' I said.
7481	'I need your help."
7482	'How, for Christ's sake? Am I supposed to track down the killer like
7483	some HTV detective? Have a fight to the fucking death on Reichenbach
7484	fucking Falls?"
7485	'That would be satisfactory, Martin. But in the meantime a few opinions
7486	and words of advice would suffice."
7487	'Opinion One,' I said, 'it was stupid to come here.
7488	Opinion Two, it's stupid to stay. Advice Alpha/Omega: leave."
7489	King Billy nodded dolefully. 'Leave this city or all of Hyperion?"
7490	I shrugged.
7491	His Majesty rose and walked to the window of my small study. It looked
7492	out across a three-meter alley to the brick wall of the automated
7493	recycling plant next door. King Billy studied the view. 'You're
7494	aware,' he
7495	said, 'of the ancient legend of the Shrike?"
7496	'I've heard bits of it."
7497	'The indigenies associate the monster with the Time Tombs,' he said.
7498	'The indigenies smear paint on their bellies for the harvest celebration
7499	and smoke unrecombinant tobacco,' I said.
7500	King Billy nodded at the wisdom of this. He said: 'The Hegemony
7501	Firstdown Team was wary of this area. They set up the multichannel
7502	recorders and kept their bases south of the Bridle."
7503	'Look,' I said, 'Your Majesty... what do you want?
7504	Absolution for screwing up and building the city here?
7505	You're absolved. Go and sin no more, my son. Now, if you don't mind,
7506	Your Royalship, adi6s. l've got dirty limericks to write here."
7507	King Billy did not turn away from the window. 'You
7508	recommend that we evacuate the city, Martin?" I hesitated only a second.
7509	'Sure." 'And would you leave with the rest?" 'Why wouldn't I?"
7510	King Billy turned and looked me in the eye. 'Would you?"
7511	I said nothing. After a minute I looked away.
7512	'I thought so,' said the ruler of the planet. He clasped his pudgy
7513	hands behind his back and stared at the wall again. 'If I were a
7514	detective,' he said, 'I would be suspicious.
7515	The city's least productive citizen starts writing again after a decade
7516	of silence only... what, Martin?
7517	· . . two days after the first murders happened. Now he's disappeared
7518	from the social life he once dominated and
7519	spends his time composing an epic poem... why, even
7520	the young girls are safe from his goatish ardor."
7521	i sighed. 'Goatish ardor, m'!ord?"
7522	King Billy glanced over his shoulder at me.
7523	'All right,' I said. 'You've got me. I confess. I've been murdering
7524	them and bathing in their blood. It works as a fucking literary
7525	aphrodisiac. I figure two... three hundred more victims, tops... and
7526	I'll have my next book ready for publication."
7527	King Billy turned back to the window.
7528	'What's the matter,' I said, 'don't you believe me?" 'No." 'Why not?"
7529	'Because,' said the King, 'I know who the murderer is."
7530	We sat in the darkened holopit and watched the Shrike kill novelist Sira
7531	Rob and her lover. The light level was very low; Sira's middle-aged
7532	flesh seemed to glow with a pale phosphorescence while her much younger
7533	boyfriend's white buttocks gave the illusion in the dim light of
7534	floating separately from the rest of his tanned body.
7535	Their lovemaking was reaching its frenzied peak when the inexplicable
7536	occurred. Rather than the final thrusts and sudden pause of orgasm, the
7537	young man seemed to levitate up and backward, rising into the air as if
7538	Sira had somehow forcefully ejected him from her body. The sound track
7539	on the disk, previously consisting of the usual banal pants, gasps,
7540	exhortations, and instructions one would expect from such activity,
7541	suddenly filled the holopit with screams- first the young man's, then
7542	Sira's.
7543	There was a thud as the boy's body struck a wall off camera. Sira's
7544	body lay waiting in tragically comic vulnerability, her legs wide, arms
7545	open, breasts flattened, thighs pale. Her head had been thrown back in
7546	ecstasy but now she had time to raise it, shock and anger already
7547	replacing the oddly similar expression of imminent orgasm. She opened
7548	her mouth to shout something.
7549	No words. There came the watermelon-carving sound of blades piercing
7550	flesh, of hooks being pulled free of
7551	tendon and bone. Sira's head went back, her mouth opened impossibly
7552	wide, and her body exploded from the breastbone down. Flesh separated a
7553	if an invisible ax were chopping Sira Rob for kindling. Unseen scalpels
7554	completed the job of opening her, lateral incisions appearing like
7555	obscene time-lapse footage of a mad surgeon's favorite operation. It
7556	was a brutal autopsy performed on a living person. On a once living
7557	person, rather, for when the blood stopped flying and the body ceased
7558	spasming, Sira's limbs relaxed in death, legs opening again in an echo
7559	of the obscene display of viscera above. And then- for the briefest
7560	second - there was a blur of red and chrome near the bed.
7561	'Freeze, expand, and augment,' King Billy told the house computer.
7562	The blur resolved itself into a head out of a jolt addict's nightmare: a
7563	face part steel, part chrome, and part skull, teeth like a mechanized
7564	wolf's crossed with a steam shovel, eyes like ruby lasers burning
7565	through blood-filled gems, forehead penetrated by a curved spike-blade
7566	rising thirty centimeters from a quicksilver
7567	skull, and a neck ringed with similar thorns.
7568	'The Shrike?" I asked.
7569	King Billy nodded - the merest movement of chin and jowls.
7570	'What happened to the boy?" I asked.
7571	'There was no sign of him when Sira's body was discovered,' said the
7572	King. 'No one knew he was missing until this disk was discovered. He
7573	has been identified as a
7574	young recreation specialist from Endymion."
7575	'You just found the holo?"
7576	'Yesterday,' said King Billy. 'The security people found the imager on
7577	the ceiling. Less than a millimeter across. Sira had a library of such
7578	disks. The camera
7579	apparently was there only to record... ah..." 'The bedroom follies,' I
7580	said.
7581	'Precisely."
7582	I stood up and approached the floating image of the creature. My hand
7583	passed through forehead, spike, and jaws. The computer had calculated
7584	its size and represented
7585	it properly. Judging from the thing's head, our local Grendel stood
7586	more than three meters tall. 'Shrike,' I
7587	muttered, more in greeting than in identification.
7588	'What can you tell me about it, Martin?"
7589	'Why ask me?" I snapped. 'I'm a poet, not a mythohistorian."
7590	'You accessed the seedship computer with a query about the Shrike's
7591	nature and origins."
7592	I raised an eyebrow. Computer access was supposed to be as private and
7593	anonymous as datasphere entry in the Hegemony. 'So what?" I said.
7594	'Hundreds of people must have checked out the Shrike legend since the
7595	killings began. Maybe thousands. It's the only fucking monster legend
7596	we've got."
7597	King Billy moved his wrinkles and folds up and down.
7598	'Yes,' he said, 'but you searched the files three months before the
7599	first disappearance."
7600	I sighed and slumped into the holopit cushions. 'All right,' I said, 'I
7601	did. So what? I wanted to use the fucking legend in the fucking poem
7602	I'm writing, so I researched it.
7603	Arrest me."
7604	'What did you learn?"
7605	I was very angry now. I stamped satyr hooves into the soft carpet.
7606	'Just the stuff in the fucking file,' I snapped.
7607	'What in the hell do you want from me, Billy?"
7608	The King rubbed his brow and winced as he accidentally stuck his little
7609	finger in his eye. 'I don't know,' he said.
7610	'The security people wanted to take you up to the ship and put you on
7611	full interrogative interface. I chose to talk to you instead."
7612	I blinked, feeling a strange zero-g sensation in my stomach.
7613	Full interrogative meant cortical shunts and sockets in the skull. Most
7614	people interrogated that way recovered fully. Most.
7615	'Can you tell me what aspect of the Shrike legend you planned to use in
7616	your poem?" King Billy asked softly.
7617	'Sure,' I said. 'According to the Shrike Cult gospel that the
7618	indigenies started, the Shrike is the Lord of Pain and the Angel of
7619	Final Atonement, come from a place beyond time to announce the end of
7620	the human race. I liked that conceit."
7621	'The end of the human race,' repeated King Billy.
7622	'Yeah. He's Michael the Archangel and Moroni and Satan and Masked
7623	Entropy and the Frankenstein monster all rolled into one package,' I
7624	said. 'He hangs around the Time Tombs waiting to come out and wreak
7625	havoc when it's mankind's time to join the dodo and the gorilla and the
7626	sperm whale on the extinction Hit Parade list."
7627	'The Frankenstein monster,' mused the short little fat man in the
7628	wrinkled cape. 'Why him?"
7629	I took a breath. 'Because the Shrike Cult believes that mankind somehow
7630	created the thing,' I said, although I
7631	knew that King Billy knew everything I knew and more.
7632	'Do they know how to kill it?" he asked.
7633	'Not that I know of. He's supposed to be immortal,
7634	beyond time."
7635	'A god?"
7636	I hesitated. 'Not really,' I said at last. 'More like one of the
7637	universe's worst nightmares come to life. Sort of like the Grim Reaper,
7638	but with a penchant for sticking souls on a giant thorn tree... while
7639	the people's souls
7640	are still in their bodies."
7641	King Billy nodded.
7642	'Look,' I said, 'if you insist on splitting hairs from back-world
7643	theologies, why don't you fly to Jacktown and ask a few of the Cult
7644	priests?"
7645	'Yes,' said the King, chin on his pudgy fist, obviously distracted,
7646	'they're already on the seedship being interrogated.
7647	It's all most confusing."
7648	I rose to leave, not sure if I would be allowed to.
7649	'Martin?" 'Yeah."
7650	· 'Before you go, can you think of anything else that could help us
7651	understand this thing?"
7652	I paused in the doorway, feeling my heart batting at my ribs to get out.
7653	'Yeah,' I said, my voice only marginally steady. 'I can tell you who
7654	and what the Shrike
7655	really is."
7656	'Oh?"
7657	'It's my muse,' I said, and turned, and went back to my room to write.
7658	Of course I had summoned the Shrike. I knew that. I had summoned it by
7659	beginning my epic poem about it. In the beginning was the Word.
7660	I retitled my poem The Hyperion Cantos. It was not about the planet but
7661	about the passing of the self-styled Titans called humans. It was about
7662	the unthinking hubris of a race which dared to murder its homeworld
7663	through sheer carelessness and then carried that dangerous arrogance to
7664	the stars, only to meet the wrath of a god which humanity had helped to
7665	sire. Hyperion was the first serious work I had done in many years and
7666	it was the best I would ever do. What began as a comic-serious homage
7667	to the ghost of John Keats became my last reason for existence, an epic
7668	tour de force in an age of mediocre farce. Hyperion Cantos was written
7669	with a skill I could never have attained, with a mastery I could never
7670	have gained, and sung in a voice which was not mine.
7671	The passing of humankind was my topic. The Shrike was my muse.
7672	A score more people died before King Billy evacuated the City of Poets.
7673	Some of the evacuees went to Endymion or Keats or one of the other new
7674	cities, but most voted to take the seedships back to the Web. King
7675	Billy's dream of a creative utopia died, although the King himself lived
7676	on in the gloomy palace at Keats.
7677	Leadership of the colony passed to the Home Rule Council, which
7678	petitioned the Hegemony for membership and immediately established a
7679	Self-defense Force.
7680	The SDF - made up primarily of the same indigenies who had been
7681	cudgelinc each other a decade before, but commanded now by self-styled
7682	officers from our new colony - succeeded only in disturbing the
7683	peacefulness of the night with their automated skimmer patrols and
7684	marring the beauty of the returning desert with their mobile
7685	surveillance mechs.
7686	Surprisingly, I was not the only one to stay behind; at least two
7687	hundred remained, although most of us avoided social contact, smiling
7688	politely when we passed on Poets' Walk or while we ate apart in the
7689	echoing emptiness of the dining dome.
7690	The murders and disappearances continued, averaging about one a local
7691	fortnight, although they were usually discovered not by us but by the
7692	regional SDF commander, who demanded a head count of citizens every few
7693	weeks.
7694	The image that remains in my mind from that first year is an unusually
7695	communal one: the night we gathered on the Commons to watch the seedship
7696	leave. It was at the height of the autumn meteor season and Hyperion's
7697	night skies were already ablaze with gold streaks and red crisscrosses
7698	of flame when the seedship's engines fired, a small sun flared, and for
7699	an hour we watched as friends and fellow artists receded as a streak of
7700	fusion flame. Sad King Billy joined us that night and I remember that
7701	he looked at me before he solemnly reentered his ornate coach to return
7702	to the safety of Keats.
7703	In the dozen years which followed I left the city half a dozen times;
7704	once to find a biosculptor who could rid me of my satyr affectation, the
7705	other times to buy food and supplies. The Shrike Temple had renewed the
7706	Shrike pilgrimages by this time, and on my trips I would use their
7707	elaborate avenue to death in reverse- the walk to Chronos Keep, the
7708	aerial tram across the Bridle Range, the windwagons, and the Charon
7709	barge down the Hoolie.
7710	Coming back, I would stare at the pilgrims and wonder who would survive.
7711	Few visited the City of Poets. Our half-finished towers began to look
7712	like tumbled ruins. The gallerias with their splendid metal-glass domes
7713	and covered arcades grew heavy with vines; pyreweed and scargrass poked
7714	up between the flagstones. The SDF added to the chaos, setting mines
7715	and booby traps to kill the Shrike, but only succeeding in devastating
7716	once beautiful sections of the city. Irrigation broke down. The
7717	aqueduct collapsed. The desert encroached. I moved from room to room
7718	in King Billy's abandoned palace, working on my poem, waiting for my
7719	muse.
7720	When you think about it, the cause-effect begins to resemble some mad
7721	logic-loop by the data artist Carolus or perhaps a print by Escher: the
7722	Shrike had come into existence
7723	because of the incantatory powers of my poem but the poem could not have
7724	existed without the threat/presence of the Shrike as muse. Perhaps I
7725	was a bit mad in those days.
7726	In a dozen years sudden death culled the city of dilettantes until only
7727	the Shrike and I remained. The annual passage of the Shrike Pilgrimage
7728	was a minor irritation, a distant caravan crossing the desert to the
7729	Time Tombs. Sometimes a few figures returned, fleeing across vermilion
7730	sands to the refuge of Chronos Keep twenty kilometers to the southwest.
7731	More often, no one emerged.
7732	I watched from the shadows of the city. My hair and beard had grown
7733	until they covered some of the rags I wore. I came out mostly at night,
7734	moving through the ruins like a furtive shadow, sometimes gazing at my
7735	lighted palace tower like David Hume peering in his own windows and
7736	solemnly deciding that he wasn't home. I never moved the food
7737	synthesizer from the dining dome to my apartments, preferring instead to
7738	eat in the echoing silence under that cracked duotoo like some addled
7739	Eloi fattening himself up for the inevitable Morlock.
7740	I never saw the Shrike. Many nights, just before dawn, I would awaken
7741	from a nap at a sudden sound -the scratch of metal on stone, the rasp of
7742	sand under something's foot - but although I was often sure that I was
7743	being watched, I never saw the watcher.
7744	Occasionally I made the short trip to the Time Tombs, especially at
7745	night, avoiding the soft, disconcerting tugs of the anti-entropic time
7746	tides while I moved through complicated shadows under the wings of the
7747	Sphinx or stared at stars through the emerald wall of the Jade Tomb. It
7748	was upon my return from one of these nocturnal pilgrimages that I found
7749	an intruder in my study.
7750	'Impressive, M-M-M-Martin,' said King Billy, tapping one of several
7751	heaps of manuscript which lay about the room. Seated in the oversized
7752	chair at the long table, the failed monarch looked old, more melted than
7753	ever. It was obvious that he had been reading for several hours.
7754	'Do you r-r-really think that mankind d-d-d-deserves
7755	such an end?" he asked softly. It had been a dozen years since I had
7756	heard the stutter.
7757	i moved away from the door but did not answer. Billy had been a friend
7758	and patron for more than twenty standard years, but at that moment I
7759	could have killed him. The thought of someone reading Hyperion without
7760	permission filled me with rage.
7761	'You d-d-date your p-p-p... cantos?" said King Billy, riffling through
7762	the most recent stack of completed pages.
7763	'How did you get here?" I snapped. It was not an idle question.
7764	Skimmers; dropships, and helicopters had not had much luck flying to the
7765	Time Tombs region in recent years. The machines arrived sans
7766	passengers. It had done wonders in fueling the Shrike myth.
7767	The little man in the rumpled cape shrugged. His uniform was meant to
7768	be brilliant and regal but merely made him look like an overweight
7769	Harlequin. 'I followed the last batch of pilgrims,' he said. 'And then
7770	c-c-came down from Keep Chronos to visit. I notice that you've written
7771	nothing in many months, M-M-Martin. Can you explain that?"
7772	I glowered in silence while sidling closer.
7773	'Perhaps I can explain it,' said King Billy. He looked at the last
7774	completed page of Hyperion Cantos as if it had the answer to a
7775	long-puzzled riddle. 'The last stanzas were written the same week last
7776	year that J.T. Telio disappeared."
7777	'So?" I had moved to the far edge of the table now.
7778	Feigning a casual attitude, I pulled a short stack of manuscript pages
7779	closer and moved them out of Billy's reach.
7780	'So that w-w-w-was... according to the SDF monitors ·.. the d-d-date
7781	of the death of the last remaining Poets' City dweller,' he said. 'The
7782	last except for y-y-you, that is, Martin."
7783	I shrugged and began moving around the table. I needed to get to Billy
7784	without getting the manuscript in the way.
7785	'You know, you haven't f-f-f-finished it, Martin,' he said in his deep,
7786	sad voice. 'There is still some hance that humanity s-s-s-survives the
7787	Fall."
7788	'No,' I said and sidled closer.
7789	'But you can't write it, can you, Martin? You can't c-c-c-compose this
7790	poetry unless your m-m-muse is shedding blood, can you?"
7791	'Bullshit,' I said.
7792	'Perhaps. But a fascinating coincidence. Have you ever wondered why
7793	you have been spared, Martin?"
7794	I shrugged again and slid another stack of papers out of his reach. I
7795	was taller, stronger, and meaner than Billy, but I had to be sure that
7796	none of the manuscript would be damaged if he struggled as I lifted him
7797	out of his seat and threw him out.
7798	'It's t-t-t-time we did something about this problem,' said my patron.
7799	'No,' I said, 'it's time you left." I shoved the last stacks of poetry
7800	aside and raised my arms, surprised to see a brass candlestick in one
7801	hand.
7802	'Stop right there, please,' King Billy said softly and lifted a neural
7803	stunner from his lap.
7804	I paused only a second. Then I laughed. 'You miserable little hangdog
7805	fraud,' I said. 'You couldn't use a fucking weapon if your life
7806	depended on it."
7807	I stepped forward to beat him up and throw him out.
7808	My cheek was against the stone of the courtyard but one eye was open
7809	enough for me to see that stars still shone through the broken
7810	latticework of the galleria dome. I could not blink. My limbs and
7811	torso tingled with the pinpricks of returning sensation, as if my entire
7812	body had fallen asleep and was now coming painfully awake. It made me
7813	want to scream, but my jaw and tongue refused to work. Suddenly I was
7814	lifted and propped against a stone bench so that I could see the
7815	courtyard and the dry fountain which Rithmet Corbet had designed. The
7816	bronze Laocon wrestled with bronze snakes in the flickering illumination
7817	of the predawn meteor showers.
7818	'I'm s-s-sorry, Martin,' came a familiar voice, 'b-b-but this
7819	m-m-madness has to end." King Billy came into my field of view carrying
7820	a tall stack of manuscript. Other heaps of pages lay on the shell of
7821	the fountain at t he foot of the metal Trojan. An open bucket of
7822	kerosene sat nearby.
7823	I managed to blink. My eyelids moved like rusted iron.
7824	'The stun should w-wowear off any s-s-s... any minute,' said King
7825	Billy. He reached into the fountain, raised a sheaf of manuscript, and
7826	ignited it with a flick of his cigarette lighter.
7827	'No!" I managed to scream through clenched jaws.
7828	The flames danced and died. King Billy let the ashes drop into the
7829	fountain and lifted another stack of pages, rolling them into a
7830	cylinder. Tears glistened on lined cheeks illuminated by flame. 'You
7831	c-c-called it f-f-forth,' gasped the little man. 'It must be
7832	f-f-finished."
7833	I struggled to rise. My arms and legs jerked like a marionette's
7834	mishandled limbs. The pain was incredible.
7835	I screamed again and the agonized sound echoed from marble and granite.
7836	King Billy lifted a fat sheaf of papers and paused to read from the top
7837	page:
7838	· Without story or prop
7839	But my own weak mortality, I bore
7840	The load of this eternal quietude,
7841	The unchanging gloom, and th three fixed shapes Ponderous upon my senses
7842	a whole moon.
7843	For by my burning brain I measured sure Her silver seasons shedded on
7844	the night And ever day by day I thought I grew
7845	More gaunt and ghostly - Oftentimes I prayed, Intense, that Death wouM
7846	take me from the vale And all its burdens - Gasping with despair Of
7847	change, hour after hour I cursed myself."
7848	King Billy raised his face to the stars and consigned this page to
7849	flame.
7850	'No!" I cried again and forced my legs to bend. I got to one knee,
7851	tried to steady myself with an arm ablaze with pinpricks, and fell on my
7852	side.
7853	The shadow in the cape lifted a stack too thick to roll and peered at it
7854	in the dim light.
7855	' Then I saw a wan face
7856	Not pinned by human sorrows, but bright blanched By an immortal sickness
7857	which kills not;
7858	It works a constant change, which happy death
7859	Can put no end to; deathwards progressing
7860	To no death was that visage; it had passed
7861	The lily and the sno w; and beyond these
7862	I must not think now, though Isaw that face..." ."
7863	King Billy moved his lighter and this and fifty other pages burst into
7864	flame. He dropped the burning papers into the fountain and reached for
7865	more.
7866	'Please!" I cried and pulled myself up, stiffening my legs against the
7867	twitches of random nerve impulses while leaning against the stone bench.
7868	'Please."
7869	The third figure did not actually appear so much as allow its presence
7870	to impinge upon my consciousness; it was as if it always had been there
7871	and King Billy and I had failed to notice it until the flames grew
7872	bright enough.
7873	Impossibly tall, four-armed, molded in chrome and cartilage, the Shrike
7874	turned its red gaze on us.
7875	King Billy gasped, stepped back, and then moved forward to feed more
7876	cantos to the fire. Embers rose on warm drafts. A flight of doves
7877	burst from the vine-choked girders of the broken dome with an explosion
7878	of wing sound.
7879	I moved forward in a motion more lurch than step. The Shrike did not
7880	move, did not shift its bloody gaze.
7881	'Go!" cried King Billy, stutter forgotten, voice exalted, a blazing mass
7882	of poetry in each hand. 'Return to the pit whence you came!'
7883	The Shrike seemed to incline its head ever so slightly.
7884	Red light gleamed on sharp surfaces.
7885	'My lord!" I cried, although to King Billy or the apparition from hell I
7886	did not know then and know not now. I staggered the last few paces and
7887	reached for Billy's arm.
7888	He was not there. One second the aging King was a hand's length from me
7889	and in the next instant he was ten meters away, raised high above the
7890	courtyard stones. Fingers like steel thorns pierced his arms and chest
7891	and thighs, but he still writhed and my Cantos burned in his fists.
7892	The Shrike held him out like a father offering his son for baptism.
7893	'Destroy it!" Billy cried, his pinned arms making pitiful gestures.
7894	'Destroy it!'
7895	I stopped at the fountain's edge, tottered weakly against the rim. At
7896	first I thought he meant destroy the Shrike... and then I thought he
7897	meant the poem...
7898	and then I realized that he meant both. A thousand pages and more of
7899	manuscript lay tumbled in the dry fountain.
7900	I picked up the bucket of kerosene.
7901	The Shrike did not move except to pull King' Billy slowly back against
7902	his chest in an oddly affectionate motion. Billy writhed and screamed
7903	silently as a long steel thorn emerged from his harlequin silk just
7904	above the breastbone. I stood there stupidly and thought of butterfly
7905	collections I had displayed as a child. Slowly, mechanically, I sloshed
7906	kerosene on the scattered pages.
7907	'End it!" gasped King Billy. 'Martin, for the love of God!'
7908	I picked up the lighter from where he had dropped it.
7909	The Shrike made no move. Blood soaked the black patches of Billy's
7910	tunic until they blended with the crimson squares already here. I
7911	thumbed the antique lighter once, twice, a third time; sparks only.
7912	Through my tears I could see my life's work lying in the dusty fountain.
7913	I dropped the lighter.
7914	Billy screamed. Dimly, I heard blades rubbing bone as he twisted in the
7915	Shrike's embrace. 'Finish it!" he cried.
7916	'Martin... oh, God!'
7917	I turned then, took five fast paces, and threw the half-full bucket of
7918	kerosene. Fumes blurred my already blurred vision. Billy and the
7919	impossible creature that held him were soaked like two comics in a
7920	slapstick holie.
7921	I saw Billy blink and splutter, I saw the slickness on the Shrike's
7922	chiseled muzzle reflect the meteor-brightened sky, and then the dying
7923	embers of burned pages in Billy's still clenched fists ignited the
7924	kerosene.
7925	I raised my hands to protect my face - too late, beard and eyebrows
7926	singed and smoldered- and staggered backward until the rim of the
7927	fountain stopped me.
7928	For a second the pyre was a perfect sculpture of flame, a blue and
7929	yellow Piet with a four-armed madonna holding a blazing Christ figure.
7930	Then the burning figure writhed and arched, still pinned by steel thorns
7931	and a score of scalpeled talons, and a cry went up which to this
7932	day I cannot believe emanated from the human half of that death-embraced
7933	pair. The scream knocked me to my knees, echoed from every hard surface
7934	in the city, and drove the pigeons into wheeling panic. And the scream
7935	continued for minutes after the flaming vision simply ceased to be,
7936	leaving behind neither ashes nor retinal image. It was another minute
7937	or two before I realized that the scream I now heard was mine.
7938	Anticlimax is, of course, the warp and way of things.
7939	Real life seldom structures a decent denouement.
7940	It took me several months, perhaps a year, to recopy the
7941	kerosene-damaged pages and to rewrite the burned Cantos. It will be no
7942	surprise to learn that I did not finish the poem. It was not by choice.
7943	My muse had fled.
7944	The City of Poets decayed in peace. I stayed another year or two -
7945	perhaps five, I do not know; I was quite mad by then. To this day
7946	records of early Shrike pilgrims tell of the gaunt figure, all hair and
7947	rags and bulging eyes, who would wake them from their Gethsemane sleep
7948	by screaming obscenities and shaking his fist at the silent Time Tombs,
7949	daring the coward within to show itself.
7950	Eventually the madness burned itself out - although the embers will
7951	always glow - and I hiked the fifteen hundred kilometers to
7952	civilization, my backpack weighted down with just manuscript, surviving
7953	on rock eels and snow and on nothing at all for the last ten days.
7954	The two and a half centuries since are not worth telling, much less
7955	reliving. The Pouisen treatments to keep the instrument alive and
7956	waiting. Two long, cold sleeps in illegal, sublight, cryogenic voyages;
7957	each swallowing a century or more; each taking its toll in brain cells
7958	and memory.
7959	I waited then. I will still. The poem must be finished. It will be
7960	finished.
7961	In the beginning was the Word.
7962	In the end... past honor, past life, past caring...
7963	In the end will be the Word.
7964	FOUR
7965	The Benares put into Edge a little after noon on the next day. One of
7966	the mantas had died in harness only twenty kilometers downriver from
7967	their destination and A. Bettik had cut it loose. The other had lasted
7968	until they tied up to the bleached pier and then it rolled over in total
7969	exhaustion, bubbles rising from its twin airholes. Bettik ordered this
7970	manta cut loose as well, explaining that it had a slim chance of
7971	surviving if it drifted along in the more rapid current.
7972	The pilgrims had been awake and watching the scenery roll by since
7973	before sunrise. They spoke little and none had found anything to say to
7974	Martin Silenus. The poet did not appear to mind... he drank wine with
7975	his breakfast and sang bawdy songs as the sun rose.
7976	The river had widened during the night and by morning it was a
7977	two-kilometer-wide highway of blue gray cutting through the low green
7978	hills south of the Sea of Grass. There were no trees this close to the
7979	Sea, and the browns and golds and heather tones of the Mane shrubs had
7980	gradually brightened to the bold greens of the two-meter-tall northern
7981	grasses. All morning the hills had been pressed lower until now they
7982	were compressed into low bands of grassy bluffs on either side of the
7983	river.
7984	An almost invisible darkening hung above the horizon to the north and
7985	east, and those pilgrims who had lived on ocean worlds and knew it as a
7986	promise of the approaching sea had to remind themselves that the only
7987	sea now near was comprised of several billion acres of grass.
7988	Edge never had been a large outpost and now it was totally deserted. The
7989	score of buildings lining the rutted lane from the dock had the vacant
7990	gaze of all abandoned
7991	structures and there were signs on the riverfront that the population
7992	had fled weeks earlier. The Pilgrims' Rest, a three-century-old inn
7993	just below the crest of the hill, had been burned.
7994	A. Bettik accompanied them to the summit of the low bluff. 'What will
7995	you do now?" Colonel Kassad asked the android.
7996	'According to the terms of the Temple bonditure, we are free after this
7997	trip,' said Bettik. ' We shall leave the Benares here for your return
7998	and take the launch downriver. And then we go on our way."
7999	'With the general evacuations?" asked Brawne Lamia.
8000	'No." Bettik smiled. 'We have our own purposes and pilgrimages on
8001	Hyperion."
8002	The group reached the rounded crest of the bluff.
8003	Behind them, the Benare seemed a small thing tied to a sagging dock; the
8004	Hoolie ran southwest into the blue haze of distance below the town and
8005	curved west above it, narrowing toward the impassable Lower Cataracts a
8006	dozen kilometers uprivcr from Edge. To their north and cast lay the Sea
8007	of Grass.
8008	'My God,' breathed Brawne Lamia.
8009	It was as if they had climbed the last hill in creation.
8010	Below them, a scattering of docks, . wharves, and sheds marked the end
8011	of Edge and the beginning of t he Sea. Grass stretched away forever,
8012	rippling sensuously in the slight breeze and seeming to lap like a green
8013	surf at the base of the bluffs. The grass seemed infinite and seamless,
8014	stretching tO all horizons and apparently rising to precisely the same
8015	height as far as the eye could see. There was not the slightest hint of
8016	the snowy peaks of the Bridle Range, which they knew lay some eight
8017	hundred kilometers to the northwest.
8018	The illusion that they were gazing at a great green sea was nearly
8019	perfect, down to the wind-ruffled shimmers of stalks looking like
8020	whitecaps far from shore.
8021	'It's beautiful,' said Lamia, who had never seen it before.
8022	'It's striking at sunset and sunrise,' said the Consul.
8023	'Fascinating,' murmured Sol Weintraub, lifting his infant so that she
8024	could see. She wiggled in happiness and concentrated on watching her
8025	fingers.
8026	'A well-preserved ecosystem,' Het Masteen said
8027	approvingly. 'The Muir would be pleased." 'Shit,' said Martin Silenus.
8028	The others turned to stare.
8029	'There's no fucking windwagon,' said the poet.
8030	The four other men, woman, and android stared silently
8031	at the abandoned wharves and empty plain of grass.
8032	' It's been delayed,' said the Consul.
8033	Martin Silenus barked a laugh. 'Or it's left already. We were supposed
8034	to be here last night."
8035	Colonel Kassad raised his powered binoculars and swept the horizon. 'I
8036	find it unlikely that they would have left without us,' he said. 'The
8037	wagon was to have been sent by the Shrike Temple priests themselves.
8038	They have a vested interest in our pilgrimage."
8039	'We could walk,' said Lenar Hoyt. The priest looked pale and weak,
8040	obviously in the grip of both pain and drugs, and barely able to stand,
8041	much less walk.
8042	' No,' said Kassad. ' It' s hundreds o f klic ks and the grass is over
8043	our heads."
8044	'Compasses,' said the priest.
8045	'Compasses don't work on Hyperion,' said Kassad, still watching through
8046	his binoculars.
8047	'Direction finders then,' said Hoyt.
8048	'We have an IDF, but that isn't the point,' said the Consul.
8049	'The grass is sharp. Halfa klick out and we'd be nothing but tatters."
8050	'And there are the grass serpents,' said Kassad, lowering the glasses.
8051	'It's a well-preserved ecosystem but not one to take a stroll in."
8052	Father Hoyt sighed and half collapsed into the short grass of the
8053	hilltop. There was something close to relief in his voice when he said.
8054	'All right, we go back."
8055	A. Bettik stepped forward. 'The crew will be happy to wait and ferry
8056	you back to Keats in the Benares should the windwagon not appear."
8057	'No,' said the Consul, 'take the launch and go."
8058	'Hey, just a fucking minute!" cried Martin Silenus. 'I don't remember
8059	electing you dictator, amigo. We need to get there. If the fucking
8060	windwagon doesn't show, we'!!
8061	have to find another way."
8062	The Consul wheeled to face the smaller man. 'How?
8063	By boat? It takes two weeks to sail up the Mane and around the North
8064	Littoral to Otho or one of the other staging areas. And that's when
8065	there are ships available.
8066	Every seagoing vessel on Hyperion is probably involved in the evacuation
8067	effort."
8068	'Dirigible then,' growled the poet.
8069	Brawne Lamia laughed. 'Oh, yes. We've seen so many in the two days
8070	we've been on the river."
8071	Martin Silenus whirled and clenched his fists as if to strike the woman.
8072	Then he smiled. 'All right then, lady, what do we do? Maybe if we
8073	sacrifice someone to a grass serpent the transportation gods will smile
8074	on as."
8075	Brawne Lamia's stare was arctic. 'I thought burned offerings were more
8076	your style, little man."
8077	Colonel Kassad stepped between the two. His voice barked command.
8078	'Enough. The Consul's right. We stay here until the wagon arrives. M.
8079	Masteen, M. Lamia, go with A. Bettik to supervise the unloading of our
8080	gear.
8081	Father Hoyt and M. Silenus will bring some wood up for a bonfire."
8082	'A bonfire?" said the priest. It was hot on the hillside.
8083	'After dark,' said Kassad. 'We want the windwagon to know we're here.
8084	Now let's move."
8085	It was a quiet group that watched the powered launch move downriver at
8086	sunset. Even from two kilometers away the Consul could see the blue
8087	skins of the crew. The Benares looked old and abandoned at its wharf,
8088	already a part of the deserted city. When the launch was lost in the
8089	distance, the group turned to watch the Sea of Grass.
8090	Long shadows from the river bluffs crept out across what the Consul
8091	already found himself thinking of as the surf and shallows. Farther
8092	out, the sea seemed to shift in color, the grass mellowing to an
8093	aquamarine shimmer before darkening to a hint of verdurous depths. The
8094	lapis sky melted into the reds and golds of sunset, illuminating their
8095	hilltop and setting the pilgrims' skins aglow with liquid light. The
8096	only sound was the whisper of wind in grass.
8097	'We've got a fucking huge heap of baggage,' Martin Silenus said loudly.
8098	'For a bunch of folks on a one-way trip."
8099	It was true, thought the Consul. Their luggage made a small mountain on
8100	the grassy hilltop.
8101	'Somewhere in there,' came the quiet voice of Het Masteen, 'may lie our
8102	salvation."
8103	'What do you mean?" asked Brawne Lamia.
8104	'Yeah,' said Martin Silenus, lying back, putting his hands under his
8105	head, and staring at the sky. 'Did you bring a pair of undershorts that
8106	are ShrikeProof?. '
8107	The Templar shook his head slowly. The sudden twilight cast his face in
8108	shadow under the cowl of the robe.
8109	'Let us not trivialize or dissemble,' he said. 'It is time to admit
8110	that each of us has brought on this pilgrimage something which he or she
8111	hopes will alter the inevitable outcome when the moment arrives that we
8112	must face the Lord of Pain."
8113	The poet laughed. 'I didn't bring even my lucky fucking rabbit's foot."
8114	The Templar's hood moved slightly. 'But your manuscript perhaps?"
8115	The poet said nothing.
8116	Het Masteen moved his invisible gaze to the tall man on his left. 'And
8117	you, Colonel, there are several trunks
8118	which bear your name. Weapons, perhaps?"
8119	Kassad raised his head but did not speak.
8120	'Of course,' said Het Masteen, 'it would be foolish to go hunting
8121	without a weapon."
8122	'What about me?" asked Brawne Lamia, folding her arms. 'Do you know
8123	what secret weapon I've smuggled along?"
8124	The Templar's oddly accented voice was calm. 'We have not yet heard
8125	your tale, M. Lamia. It would be premature to speculate."
8126	'What about the Consul?" asked Lamia.
8127	'Oh, yes, it is obvious what weapon our diplomatic friend has in store."
8128	The Consul turned from his contemplation of the sunset. 'I brought only
8129	some clothes and two books to read,' he said truthfully.
8130	'Ah,' sighed the Templar, 'but what a beautiful spacecraft you left
8131	behind."
8132	Martin Silenus jumped to his feet. 'The fucking ship!' he cried. 'You
8133	can call it, can't you? Well, goddammit, get your dog whistle out, l'm
8134	tired of sitting here."
8135	The Consul pulled a strand of grass and stripped it.
8136	After a minute he said:
8137	'Even if I could call it... and you heard A. Bettik say that the
8138	comsats and repeater stations were down...
8139	even if I could call it, we couldn't land north of the Bridle Range.
8140	That meant instant disaster even before the Shrike began ranging south
8141	of the mountains."
8142	'Yeah,' said Silenus, waving his arms in agitation, 'but we could get
8143	across this fucking... lawn! Call the ship."
8144	'Walt until morning,' said the Consul. 'If the wind-wagon's not here,
8145	we will discuss alternatives."
8146	'Fuck that..." began the poet, but Kassad stepped forward with his back
8147	to him, effectively removing Silenus from the circle.
8148	'M. Masteen,' said the Colonel, 'what is your secret?" There was enough
8149	light from the dying sky to show a slight smile on the Templar's thin
8150	lips. He gestured toward the mound of baggage. 'As you see, my trunk
8151	is the heaviest and most mysterious of all."
8152	'It's a MObius cube,' said Father Hoyt. 'l've seen
8153	ancient artifacts transported that way."
8154	'Or fusion bombs,' said Kassad.
8155	Het Masteen shook his head. 'Nothing so crude,' he said.
8156	'Are you going to tell us?" demanded Lamia.
8157	'When it is my turn to speak,' said the Templar.
8158	'Are you next?" asked the Consul. 'We can listen while we wait."
8159	Sol Weintraub cleared his throat. 'I have number four,' he said,
8160	showing the slip of paper. 'But I would be more than pleased to trade
8161	with the True Voice of the Tree." Weintraub lifted Rachel from his left
8162	shoulder to his right, patting her gently on the back.
8163	Het Masteen shook his head. 'No, there is time. I meant only to point
8164	out that in hopelessness there is always hope. We have learned much
8165	from the stories so
8166	far. Yet each of us has some seed of promise buried even deeper than we
8167	have admitted."
8168	'I don't see . . ." began Father Hoyt but was interrupted by Martin
8169	Silenus's sudden shout.
8170	'It's the wagon! The fucking windwagon. Here at last!'
8171	It was another twenty minutes before the windwagon tied up to one of the
8172	wharves. The craft came out of the north, its sails white squares
8173	against a dark plain draining of color. The last light had faded by the
8174	time the large ship had tacked close to the low bluff, folded its main
8175	sails, and rolled to a stop.
8176	The Consul was impressed. The thing was wooden, handcrafted, and huge -
8177	curved in the pregnant lines of some seagoing galleon out of Old Earth's
8178	ancient history.
8179	The single gigantic wheel, set in the center of the curving hull,
8180	normally would have been invisible in the two-meter-tall grass, but the
8181	Consul caught a glimpse of the underside as he carried luggage onto the
8182	wharf. From the ground it would be six or seven meters to the railing,
8183	and more than five times that height to the tip of the mainmast. From
8184	where he stood, panting from exertion, the Consul could hear the snap of
8185	pennants far above and a steady, almost subsonic hum that would be
8186	coming from either the ship's interior flywheel or its massive
8187	gyroscopes.
8188	A gangplank extruded from the upper hull and lowered itself to the
8189	wharf. Father Hoyt and Brawne Lamia had to step back quickly or be
8190	crushed.
8191	The windwagon was less well lighted than the Benares; illumination
8192	appeared to consist of several lanterns hanging from spars. No crew had
8193	been visible during the approach of the ship and no one came into view
8194	nOW.
8195	'Hallo!" called the Consul from the base of the gangplank.
8196	No one answered.
8197	'Wait here a minute, please,' said Kassad and mounted the long ramp in
8198	five strides.
8199	The others watched while Kassad paused at the top, touched his belt
8200	where the small deathwand was tucked,
8201	and then disappeared amidships. Several minutes later a light flared
8202	through broad windows at the stern, casting trapezoids of yellow on the
8203	grass below.
8204	'Come up,' called Kassad from the head of the ramp.
8205	'It's empty."
8206	The group struggled with their luggage, making several trips. The
8207	Consul helped Her Masteen with the heavy MObius cube and through his
8208	fingertips he could feel a faint but intense vibration.
8209	'So where the fuck is the crew?" asked Martin Silenus when they were
8210	assembled on the foredeck. They had taken their single-file tour
8211	through the narrow corridors and cabins, down stairways more ladder than
8212	stairs, and through cabins not much bigger than the built-in bunks they
8213	contained. Only the rearmost cabin - the captain's cabin, if that is
8214	what it was - approached the size and comfort of standard accommodations
8215	on the Benares.
8216	'It's obviously automated,' said Kassad. The FORCE officer pointed to
8217	halyards which disappeared into slots in the deck, manipulators all but
8218	invisible among the rigging and spars, and the subtle hint of gears
8219	halfway up the lateen-rigged rear mast.
8220	'I didn't see a control center,' said Lamia. 'Not so much as a diskey
8221	or C-spot nexus." She slipped her comlog from a breast pocket and tried
8222	to interface on standard data, comm, and biomed frequencies. There was
8223	no response from the ship.
8224	'The ships used to be crewed,' said the Consul. 'Temple initiates used
8225	to accompany the pilgrims to the mountains."
8226	'We!!, they're not here now,' said Hoyt. 'But I guess we can assume
8227	that someone is still alive at the tram station or Keep Chronos. They
8228	sent the wagon for us."
8229	'Or everyone's dead and the windwagon is running on an automatic
8230	schedule,' said Lamia. She looked over her shoulders as rigging and
8231	canvas creaked in a suddengust of wind. 'Damn, it's weird to be cut off
8232	from everybody and everything like this. It's like being blind and
8233	deaf. I don't know how colonials stand it."
8234	Martin Silenus approached the group and sat on the railing. He drank
8235	from a long green bottle and said:
8236	'Where's the Poet? Show him! Show him,
8237	Muses mine, that I may know him!
8238	'Tis the man who with a man
8239	Is an equal, be he king,
8240	Or poorest of the beggar-class,
8241	Or any other wondrous thing
8242	A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato.
8243	'Tis the man who with a bird,
8244	Wren or eagle, finds his way to
8245	A !! its instincts. He hath heard
8246	The !ion's roaring, and can tell
8247	What his horny throat expresseth, And to him the tiger's yell
8248	Comes articulate and presseth
8249	On his ear like mother-tongue. '
8250	'Where did you get that wine bottle?" asked Kassad.
8251	Martin Silenus smiled. His eyes were small and bright in the lantern
8252	glow. 'The gailery's fully stocked and there's a bar. I declared it
8253	open."
8254	'We should fix some dinner,' said the Consul although all he wanted at
8255	the moment was some wine. It had been more than ten hours since they
8256	had last eaten.
8257	There came a clank and whir and all six of them moved to the starboard
8258	rail. The gangplank had drawn itself in.
8259	They whirled again as canvas unfurled, lines grew taut, and somewhere a
8260	flywheel hummed into the ultrasonic.
8261	Sails filled, the deck tilted slightly, and the windwagon moved away
8262	from the wharf and into the darkness. The only sounds were the flap and
8263	creak of the ship, the distant rumble of the wheel, and the rasp of
8264	grass on the hull bottom.
8265	The six of them watched as the shadow of the bluff fell behind, the
8266	unlighted beacon pyre receding as a faint gleam of starlight on pale
8267	wood, and then there were only the sky and night and swaying circles of
8268	lantern light.
8269	'I'II go below,' said the Consul, 'and see if I can get a meal
8270	together."
8271	The others stayed awhile, feeling the slight surge and rumble through
8272	the soles of their feet and watching
8273	darkness pass. The Sea of Grass was visible only as the place where
8274	stars ended and flat blackness began. Kassad used a handbeam to
8275	illuminate glimpses of canvas and rigging, lines being pulled tight by
8276	invisible !ands, and then he checked all the corners and shadowed places
8277	from stern to bow. The others watched in silence. When he clicked the
8278	light off, the darkness seemed less oppressive, the starlight brighter.
8279	A rich, fertile smell - more of a farm in springtime than of the sea -
8280	came to them on a breeze which had swept across a thousand kilometers of
8281	grass.
8282	Sometime later the Consul called to them and they went below to eat.
8283	The galley was cramped and there was no mess table, so they used the
8284	large cabin in the stern as their common room, pushing three of the
8285	trunks together as a makeshift table. Four lanterns swinging from low
8286	beams made the room bright. A breeze blew in when Het Masteen opened
8287	one of the tall windows above the bed..
8288	The Consul set plates piled high with sandwiches on the largest trunk
8289	and returned again with thick white cups and a coffee therm. He poured
8290	while the others ate.
8291	'This is quite good,' said Fedmahn Kassad. 'Where did you get the roast
8292	been'
8293	'The cold box is fully stocked. There's another large freezer in the
8294	aft pantry."
8295	'Electrical?" asked Het Masteen.
8296	'No. Double insulated."
8297	Martin Silenus sniffed ajar, found a knife on the sandwich plate, and
8298	added great dollops of horseradish to his sandwiches. His eyes sparkled
8299	with tears as he ate.
8300	'How long does this crossing generally take?" Lamia asked the Consul.
8301	He looked up from his study of the circle of hot black coffee in his
8302	cup. T m sorry, what?"
8303	'Crossing the Sea of Grass. How long?"
8304	'A night and half a day to the mountains,' said the Consul. 'If the
8305	winds are with us."
8306	'And then... how long to cross the mountains?" asked Father Hoyt.
8307	'Less than a day,' sid the Consul.
8308	'If the tramway is running,' added Kassad.
8309	The Consul sipped the hot coffee and made a face.
8310	'We have to assume it is. Otherwise..."
8311	'Otherwise what?" demanded Lamia.
8312	'Otherwise,' said Colonel Kassad, moving to the open window and putting
8313	his hands on his hips, 'we will he stranded six hundred klicks from the
8314	Time Tombs and a thousand from the southern cities."
8315	The Consul shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'The Temple. priests or
8316	whoever are behind this pilgrimage have seen to it that we've gotten
8317	this far. They'll make sure we go all the way."
8318	Brawne Lamia crossed her arms and frowned. 'As what... sacrifices?"
8319	Martin Silenus whooped a laugh and brought out his bottle:
8320	'Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
8321	To what green altar, 0 mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heifer
8322	lowing at the skies,
8323	And all her silken flanks with garlands dressed?
8324	What little town by river or sea-shore,
8325	Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
8326	Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?
8327	And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a
8328	soul, to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. '
8329	Brawne Lamia reached under her tunic and brought out a cutting laser no
8330	larger than her little finger. She aimed it at the poet's head. 'You
8331	miserable little shit.
8332	One more word out of you and... I swear... I'll slag you where you
8333	stand."
8334	The silence was suddenly absolute except for the background rumble-groan
8335	of the ship. The Consul moved toward Martin Silenus. Colonel Kassad
8336	took two steps behind Lamia.
8337	The poet took a long drink and smiled at the dark-haired woman. His
8338	lips were moist. 'Oh build your ship of death,' he whispered. 'Oh
8339	build it!'
8340	Lamia's fingers were white on the pencil laser. The Consul edged closer
8341	to Silenus, not knowing what to do, imagining the whipping beam of light
8342	fusing his own eyes.
8343	Kassad leaned toward Lamia like two meters of tensed shadow.
8344	'Madam,' said Sol Weintraub from where he sat on the bunk against the
8345	far wall, 'need I remind you that there is a child present?"
8346	Lamia glanced to her right. Weintraub had removed a deep drawer from a
8347	ship's cupboard and had set it on the bed as a cradle. He had bathed
8348	the infant and come in silently just before the poet's recitation. Now
8349	he set the baby softly in the padded nest.
8350	'l'm sorry,' said Brawne Lamia and lowered the small laser." It's just
8351	that he makes me so... angry."
8352	Weintraub nodded, rocking the drawer slightly. The gentle roll of the
8353	windwagon combined with the incessant rumble of the great wheel appeared
8354	to have already put the child to sleep. 'We're all tired and tense,'
8355	said the scholar.
8356	'Perhaps we should find our lodgings for the night and turn in."
8357	The woman sighed and tucked the weapon in her belt." I won't sleep,' she
8358	said. 'Things are too... strange."
8359	Others nodded. Martin Silenus was sitting on the broad ledge below the
8360	stern windows. Now he pulled up his legs, took a drink, and said to
8361	Weintraub, 'Tell your story, old man."
8362	'Yes,' said Father Hoyt. The priest looked exhausted to the point of
8363	being cadaverous, but his feverish eyes burned. 'Tell us. We need to
8364	have the stories told and time to think about them before we arrive."
8365	Weintraub passed a hand across his bald scalp. 'It's a dull tale,' he
8366	said." l've been to Hyperion be fore. There are no confrontations with
8367	monsters, no acts of heroism. It's a tale by a man whose idea of epic
8368	adventure is speaking to a class without his notes."
8369	'All the better,' said Martin Silenus. 'We need a soporific."
8370	Sol Weintraub sighed, adjusted his glasses, and nodded.
8371	There were a few streaks of dark in his heard, but most of it had gone
8372	gray. He turned the lantern low over the baby's
8373	bed and moved to a chair in the center of the room.
8374	The Consul turned down the other lamps and poured more coffee for those
8375	who wanted it. Sol Weintraub's voice was slow, careful in phrase and
8376	precise in wording, and before long the gentle cadence of his story
8377	blended with the soft rumble and slow pitchings of the windwagon's
8378	progress north.
8379	THE SCHOLAR'S TALE:
8380	The River Lethe's Taste is Bitter
8381	Sol Weintraub and his wife Sarai had enjoyed their life even before the
8382	birth of their daughter; Rachel made things as close to perfect as the
8383	couple could imagine.
8384	Sarai was twenty-seven when the child was conceived, Sol was
8385	twenty-nine. Neither of them had considered Poulsen treatments because
8386	neither of them could afford it, but even without such care they looked
8387	forward to another fifty years of health.
8388	Both had lived their entire lives on Barnard's World, one of the oldest
8389	but least exciting members of the Hegemony. Barnard's was in the Web,
8390	but it made little difference to Sol and Sarai since they could not
8391	afford frequent farcaster travel and had little wish to go at any rate.
8392	Sol had recently celebrated his tenth year with Nightenhelser College,
8393	where he taught history and classical studies and did his own research
8394	on ethical evolution.
8395	Nightenhelser was a small school, fewer than three thousand students,
8396	but its academic reputation was outstanding and it attracted young
8397	people from all over the Web. The primary complaint of these students
8398	was that Nightenhelser and its surrounding community of Crawford
8399	constituted an island of civilization in an ocean of corn. It was true;
8400	the college was three thousand flat kilometers away from the capital of
8401	Bussard and the terraformed land in between was given over to farming.
8402	There had been no forests to fell, no hills to deal with, and no
8403	mountains to break the flat monotony of cornfields, bean-fields,
8404	cornfields, wheatfields, cornfields, rice paddies, and cornfields. The
8405	radical poet Salmud
8406	Brevy had taught briefly at Nightenhelser before the Glennon-Height
8407	Mutiny, had been fired, and upon far-casting to Renaissance Vector had
8408	told his friends that Crawford County on South Sinzer on Barnard's World
8409	constituted the Eighth Circle of Desolation on the smallest pimple on
8410	the absolute ass-end of Creation.
8411	Sol and Sarai Weintraub liked it. Crawford, a town of twenty-five
8412	thousand, might have been reconstructed from some nineteenth-century
8413	mid-American template.
8414	The streets were wide and over-arched with elms and oaks. (Barnard's
8415	had been the second extrasolar Earth colony, centuries before the
8416	Hawking drive and Hegira, and the seedships then had been huge.) Homes
8417	in Crawford reflected styles ranging from early Victorian to Canadian
8418	Revival, but they all seemed to be white and set far back on
8419	weil-trimmed lawns.
8420	The college itself was Georgian, an assemblage of red brick and white
8421	pillars surrounding the oval common.
8422	Sol's office was on the third floor of Placher Hall, the oldest building
8423	on campus, and in the winter he could look out on bare branches which
8424	carved the common into complex geometries. Sol loved the chalk-dust and
8425	old-wood smell of the place, a smell which had not changed since he was
8426	a freshman there, and each day climbing to his office he treasured the
8427	deeply worn grooves in the steps, a legacy of twenty generations of
8428	Nightenhelser students.
8429	Sarai had been born on a farm halfway between Bussard and Crawford and
8430	had received her PhD in music theory a year before Sol earned his
8431	doctorate. She had been a happy and energetic young woman, making up in
8432	personality what she lacked in accepted norms of physical beauty, and
8433	she carried this attractiveness of person into later life. Sarai had
8434	studied offworld for two years at the University of New Lyons on Deneb
8435	Drei, but she was homesick there: the sunsets were abrupt, the
8436	much-vaunted mountains slicing off the sunlight like a ragged scythe,
8437	and she longed for the hours-long sunsets of home where Barnard's Star
8438	hung on the horizon like a great, tethered, red balloon while the sky
8439	congealed to evening. She missed the perfect flatness where - peering
8440	from her third-floor room under the steep gables- a little girl could
8441	look fifty kilometers across tasseled fields to watch a storm approach
8442	like a bruise-black curtain lit within by lightning bolts. And Sarai
8443	missed her family.
8444	She and Sot met a week after she transferred to Night-enhelser; it was
8445	another three years before he proposed marriage and she accepted. At
8446	first she saw nothing in the short graduate student. She was still
8447	wearing Web fashions then, involved in Post-Destructionist music
8448	theories, reading Obit and Nihil and the most avant-garde magazines from
8449	Renaissance Vector and TC2, feigning sophisticated weariness with life
8450	and a rebel's vocabulary - and none of this jelled with the undersized
8451	.but earnest history major who spilled fruit cocktail on her at Dean
8452	Moore's honors party. Any exotic qualities which might have come from
8453	Sol Weintraub's Jewish legacy were instantly negated by his BW accent,
8454	his Crawford Squire Shop wardrobe, and the fact that he had come to the
8455	party with a copy of Detresque's Solitudes in Variance absentmindedly
8456	tucked under his arm.
8457	For Sol it was love at first sight. He stared at the laughing,
8458	red-cheeked girl and ignored the expensive dress and affected mandarin
8459	nails in favor of the personality which blazed like a beacon to the
8460	lonely junior. Sol had not known he was lonely until he met Sarai, but
8461	after the first time he shook her hand and spilled fruit salad down the
8462	front of her dress he knew that his life would be empty forever if they
8463	did not marry.
8464	They married the week after the announcement of Sol's teaching
8465	appointment at the college. Their honeymoon was on Maui-Covenant, his
8466	first farcast trip abroad, and for three weeks they rented a mobile isle
8467	and sailed alone on it through the wonders of the Equatorial
8468	Archipelago. Sol never forgot the images from those sun-drenched and
8469	wind-filled days, and the secret image he would always most cherish was
8470	of Sarai rising nude from a nighttime swim, the Core stars blazing above
8471	while her own body glowed constellations from the phosphorescence of the
8472	island's wake.
8473	They had wanted a child immediately but it was to be five years before
8474	nature agreed.
8475	Sol remembered cradling Sarai in his arms as she curled in pain, a
8476	difficult delivery, until finally, incredibly, Rachel Sarah Weintraub
8477	was born at 2:0I A.M. in Crawford County Med Center.
8478	The presence of an infant intruded upon Sol's solipsistic life as a
8479	serious academic and Sarai's profession as music critic for Barnard's
8480	datasphere, but neither minded. The first months were a blend of
8481	constant fatigue and joy. Late at night, between feedings, Sol would
8482	tiptoe into the nursery just to check on Rachel and to stand and gaze at
8483	the baby. More often than not he would find Sarai already there and the
8484	two would watch, arm in arm, at the miracle of a baby sleeping on its
8485	stomach, rump in the air, head burrowed into the bumper pad at the head
8486	of the crib.
8487	Rachel was one of those rare children who managed to be cute without
8488	becoming self-consciously precious; by the time she was two standard
8489	years old her appearance and personality were striking - her mother's
8490	light brown hair, red cheeks, and broad smile, her father's large brown
8491	eyes. Friends said that the child combined the best portions of Sarai's
8492	sensitivity and Sol's intellect.
8493	Another friend, a child psychologist from the college, once commented
8494	that Rachel at age five showed the most reliable indicators of true
8495	giftedness in a young person: structured curiosity, empathy for others,
8496	compassion, and a fierce sense of fair play.
8497	One day in his office, studying ancient files from Old Earth, Sol was
8498	reading about the effect of Beatrice on the world view of Dante
8499	Alighieri when he was struck by a passage written by a critic from the
8500	twentieth or twenty-first century:
8501	She [Beatrice] alone was still real for him, still implied meaning in
8502	the world, and beauty. Her nature became his landmark- what Melville
8503	would call, with more sobriety than we can now muster, his Greenwich
8504	Standard...
8505	Sol paused to access the definition of Greenwich Standard, and then he
8506	read on. The critic had added a personal note:
8507	Most of us, I hope, have had some child or spouse or friend like
8508	Beatrice, someone who by his very nature, his seemingly innate goodness
8509	and intelligence, makes us uncomfortably conscious of our lies when we
8510	lie.
8511	Sol had shut off the display and gazed out at the black geometries of
8512	branches above the common.
8513	Rachel was not insufferably perfect. When she was five standard, she
8514	carefully cut the hair of her five favorite dolls and then cut her own
8515	hair shortest of all. When she was seven, she decided that the migrant
8516	workers staying in their run-down houses on the south end of town lacked
8517	a nutritious diet, so she emptied the house's pantries, cold boxes,
8518	freezers, and synthesizer banks, talked three friends into accompanying
8519	her, and distributed several hundred marks' worth of the family's
8520	monthly food budget.
8521	When she was ten, Rachel responded to a dare from Stubby Berkowitz and
8522	tried to climb to the top of Crawford's oldest elm. She was forty
8523	meters up, less than five meters from the top, when a branch broke and
8524	she fell two thirds of the way to the ground. Sol was paged on his
8525	comlog while discussing the moral implications of Earth's first nuclear
8526	disarmament era and he left the class without a word and ran the twelve
8527	blocks to the Med Center.
8528	Rachel had broken her left leg, two ribs, punctured a lung, and
8529	fractured her jaw. She was floating in a bath of recovery nutrient when
8530	Sol burst in, but she managed to look over her mother's shoulder, smile
8531	slightly, and say through the wire cast on her jaw: 'Dad, I was fifteen
8532	feet from the top. Maybe closer. I'll make it next time."
8533	Rachel graduated with honors from secondary tutorials and received
8534	scholarship offers from corporate academies on five worlds and three
8535	universities, including Harvard on New Earth. She chose Nightenhelser.
8536	it was little surprise to Sol that his daughter chose
8537	archaeology as a major. One of his fondest memories of her was the long
8538	afternoons she had spent under the front porch when she was about two,
8539	digging in the loam, ignoring spiders and googlepeds, rushing into the
8540	house to show off every plastic plate and tarnished pfennig she had
8541	excavated, demanding to know where it had come from, what were the
8542	people like who had left it there?"
8543	Rachel received her undergraduate degree when she was nineteen standard,
8544	worked that summer on her grandmother's farm, and farcast away the next
8545	fall. She was at Reichs University on Freeholm for twenty-eight local
8546	months, and when she returned it was as if color had flowed back into
8547	Sol and Sarai's world.
8548	For two weeks their daughter - an adult now, self-aware and secure in
8549	some ways that grown-ups twice her age often failed to be - rested and
8550	reveled in being home.
8551	One evening, walking across the campus just after sunset, she pressed
8552	her father on details of his heritage.
8553	'Dad, do you still consider yourself a Jew?"
8554	Sol had run his hand over his thinning hair, surprised by the question.
8555	'A Jew? Yes, I suppose so. It doesn't mean what it once did, though."
8556	'Am I a Jew?" asked Rachel. Her cheeks glowed in the fragile light.
8557	'If you want to be,' said Sol. 'It doesn't have the same significance
8558	with Old Earth gone."
8559	'If l'd been a boy, would you have had me circumcised?"
8560	Sol had laughed, delighted and embarrassed by the question.
8561	'l'm serious,' said Rachel.
8562	Sol adjusted his glasses. 'I guess I would have, kiddo. I never
8563	thought about it."
8564	'Have you been to the synagogue in Bussard?"
8565	'Not since my bar mitzvah,' said Sol, thinking back to the day fifty
8566	years earlier when his father had borrowed Uncle Richard's Vikken and
8567	had flown the family to the capital for the ritual.
8568	'Dad, why do Jews feel that things are... less important now than
8569	before the Hegira?"
8570	Sol spread his hands - strong hands, more those of a stoneworker than an
8571	academic. 'That's a good question, Rachel. Probably because so much of
8572	the dream is dead.
8573	Israel is gone. The New Temple lasted less time than the first and
8574	second. God broke His word by destroying the Earth a second time in the
8575	way He did. And this Diaspora is... forever."
8576	'But Jews maintain their ethnic and religious identity in some places,'
8577	his daughter insisted.
8578	'Oh, sure. On Hebron and isolated areas of the Concourse you can find
8579	entire communities . . . Hasidic, Orthodox, Hasmonean, you name it...
8580	but they tend to
8581	be... nonvital, picturesque... tourist-oriented." 'Like a theme park?"
8582	'Yes."
8583	'Could you take me to Temple Beth-el tomorrow? I can borrow Khaki's
8584	strat."
8585	'No need,' said Sol. 'We'll use the co!lege's shuttle." He paused.
8586	'Yes,' he said at last, 'I would like to take you to the synagogue
8587	tomorrow."
8588	It was getting dark under the old elms. Streetlights came on up and
8589	down the wide lane which led to their home.
8590	'Dad,' said Rachel, 'l'm going to ask you a question l've asked about a
8591	million times since I was two. Do you believe in God?"
8592	Sol had not smiled. He had no choice but to give her the answer he had
8593	given her a million times. 'l'm waiting to,' he said.
8594	Rachel's postgraduate work dealt with alien and pre-Hegira artifacts.
8595	For three standard years Sol and Sarai would receive occasional visits
8596	followed by fatline flim-sies from exotic worlds near but not within the
8597	Web. They all knew that her field work in quest of dissertation would
8598	soon take her beyond the Web, into the Outback where time-debt ate away
8599	at the lives and memories of those left behind.
8600	'Where the hell is Hyperion?" Sarai had asked during Rachei's last
8601	vacation before the expedition left.
8602	'It sounds like a brand name' for some new household product."
8603	'It's a great place, Mom. There are more nonhuman artifacts there than
8604	any place except Armaghast."
8605	'Then why not go to Armaghast?" said Sarai. 'It's only a few months
8606	from the Web. Why settle for second best?"
8607	'Hyperion hasn't become the big tourist attraction yet,' said Rachel.
8608	'Although they're beginning to become a problem. People with money are
8609	more willing to travel outside the Web now."
8610	Sol had found his voice suddenly husky. 'Will you be going to the
8611	labyrinth or the artifacts called the Time Tombs?"
8612	'The Time Tombs, Dad. I'll be.working with Dr Melio Arundez and he
8613	knows more about the Tombs than anyone alive."
8614	'Aren't they dangerous?" asked Sol, framing the question as casually as
8615	he could but heating the edge in his voice.
8616	Rachel smiled. 'Because of the Shrike legend? No.
8617	Nobody's been bothered by that particular legend for two standard
8618	centuries."
8619	'But I've seen documents about the trouble there during the second
8620	colonization..." began Sol.
8621	'Me too, Dad. But they didn't know about the big rock eels that came
8622	down into the desert to hunt. They probably lost a few people to those
8623	things and panicked. You know how legends begin. Besides, the rock
8624	eels have been hunted to extinction."
8625	'Spacecraft don't !and there,' persisted Sol. 'You have to sail to the
8626	Tombs. Or hike. Or some damn thing."
8627	Rachel laughed. 'In the early days, people flying in underestimated the
8628	effects of the anti-entropic fields and there were some accidents. But
8629	there's dirigible service now. They have a big hotel called Keep
8630	Chronos at the north edge of the mountains where hundreds of tourists a
8631	year stay."
8632	'Will you be staying there?" asked Sarai.
8633	'Part of the time. It'll be exciting, Mom."
8634	'Not too exciting, I hope,' said Sarai and all of them had smiled.
8635	During the four years that Rachel was in transit - a few weeks of
8636	cryogenic fugue for her - Sol found that he missed his daughter much
8637	more than if she had been out of touch but busy somewhere in the Web.
8638	The thought that she was flying away from him faster than the speed of
8639	light, wrapped in the artificial quantum cocoon of the Hawking effect,
8640	seemed unnatural and ominous to him.
8641	They kept busy. Sarai retired from the critic business to devote more
8642	time to local environmental issues, but for Sol it was one of the most
8643	hectic times of his life.
8644	His second and third books came out and the second one - Moral Turning
8645	Points - caused such a stir that he was in constant demand at offworld
8646	conferences and symposia. He traveled to a few alone, to a few more
8647	with Sarai, but although both of them enjoyed the idea of traveling, the
8648	actual experience of facing strange foods, different gravities, and the
8649	light from strange suns all paled after a while and Sol found himself
8650	spending more time at home researching his next book, attending
8651	conferences, if he had to, via interactive holo from the college.
8652	It was almost five years after Rachel left on her expedition that Sol
8653	had a dream which would change his life.
8654	Sol dreamed that he was wandering through a great structure with columns
8655	the size of small redwood trees and a ceiling lost to sight far above
8656	him, through which red light fell in solid shafts. At times he caught
8657	glimpses of things far off in the gloom to his left or right: once he
8658	made out a pair of stone legs rising like massive buildings through the
8659	darkness; another time he spied what appeared to be a crystal scarab
8660	rotating far above him, its insides ablaze with cool lights.
8661	Finally Sol stopped to rest. Far behind him he could hear what sounded
8662	like a great conflagration, entire cities and forests burning. Ahead of
8663	him glowed the lights he had been walking toward, two ovals of deepest
8664	red.
8665	He was mopping sweat from his brow when an immense voice said to him:
8666	'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, whom you love, and
8667	go to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering
8668	at one of the places of which I shall tell you."
8669	And in his dream Sol had stood and said, 'You can't be serious." And he
8670	had walked on through darkness, the red orbs glowing now like bloody
8671	moons hanging above an indistinct plain, and when he stopped to rest the
8672	immense voice said:
8673	'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, whom you love, and
8674	go to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering
8675	at one of the places of which I shall tell you."
8676	And SOl had shrugged off the weight of the voice and had said distinctly
8677	into the darkness, 'I heard you the first time... the answer is still
8678	no."
8679	SO! knew he was dreaming then, and part of his mind enjoyed the irony
8680	of the script, but another part wanted only to waken. Instead, he found
8681	himself on a low balcony looking down on a room where Rachel lay naked
8682	on a broad block of stone. The scene was illuminated by the glow of the
8683	twin red orbs. Sol looked down at his right hand and found a long,
8684	curved knife there. The blade and handle appeared to be made of bone.
8685	The voice, sounding more than ever to Sol like some cut-rate holie
8686	director's shallow idea of what God's voice should sound like, came
8687	again:
8688	'SOl! You must listen well. The future of humankind depends upon your
8689	obedience in this matter.
8690	You must take your daughter, your daughter Rachel whom you love, and go
8691	to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering at
8692	one of the places of which I shall tell you."
8693	And Sol, sick of the whole dream yet somehow alarmed by it, had turned
8694	and thrown the knife far into the darkness.
8695	When he turned back to find his daughter, the
8696	scene had faded. The red orbs hung closer than ever, and now So! could
8697	see that they were multifaceted gems the size of small worlds.
8698	The amplified voice came again:
8699	'So? You have had your chance, SOl Weintraub.
8700	If you change your mind, you know where to find me."
8701	And SOl awakened half laughing, half chilled by the dream. Amused by
8702	the thought that the entire Talmud and the Old Testament might be
8703	nothing more than a cosmic shaggy-dog story.
8704	About the time Sol was having his dream, Rachel was on Hyperion
8705	finishing her first year of research there. The team of nine
8706	archaeologists and six physicists had found Keep Chronos fascinating but
8707	far too crowded with tourists and would-be Shrike pilgrims, so after the
8708	first month spent commuting from the hotel, they had set up a permanent
8709	camp between the ruined city and the small canyon holding the Time
8710	Tombs.
8711	While half the team excavated the more recent site of the unfinished
8712	city, two of Rachel's colleagues helped her catalogue every aspect of
8713	the Tombs. The physicists were finished with the anti-entropic fields
8714	and spent much of their time setting small flags of different colors to
8715	mark the limits of the so-called time tides.
8716	Rachel's team concentrated their work in the structure called the
8717	Sphinx, although the creature represented in stone was neither human nor
8718	lion; it may not have been a creature at all, although the smooth lines
8719	atop the stone monolith suggested curves of a living thing, and the
8720	sweeping appendages made everyone think of wings.
8721	Unlike the other Tombs, which lay open and were easily inspected, the
8722	Sphinx was a mass of heavy blocks honey-combed with narrow corridors,
8723	some of which tightened to impossibility, some of which widened to
8724	auditorium-sized proportions, but none of which led anywhere but back on
8725	themselves. There were no crypts, treasure rooms, plundered sarcophogi,
8726	wall murals, or secret
8727	passages, merely a maze of senseless corridors through sweating stone.
8728	Rachel and her lover, Melio Arundez, began mapping the Sphinx, using a
8729	method which had been in use for at least seven hundred years, having
8730	been pioneered in the Egyptian pyramids sometime in the twentieth
8731	century.
8732	Arranging sensitive radiation and cosmic ray detectors at the lowest
8733	point in the Sphinx, they recorded arrival times and deflection patterns
8734	of the particles passing through the mass of stone above them, watching
8735	for hidden rooms or passages which would not show up even on deep
8736	imaging radar. Because of the busy tourist season and the concern of
8737	the Hyperion Home Rule Council that the Tombs might be damaged by such
8738	research, Rachel and Melio went out to their site every night at
8739	midnight, making the half-hour walk and crawl through the corridor maze
8740	which they had rigged with blue glow-globes.
8741	There, sitting under hundreds of thousands of tons of stone, they would
8742	watch their instruments until morning, listening to their earphones ping
8743	with the sound of particles born in the belly of dying stars.
8744	The time tides had not been a problem with the Sphinx. Of all the
8745	Tombs, it seemed the least protected by the anti-entropic fields and the
8746	physicists had carefully mapped the times when the tide surges might
8747	pose a threat. High tide was at I000 hours, receding only twenty
8748	minutes later back toward the Jade Tomb half a kilometer to the south.
8749	Tourists were not allowed near the Sphinx until after I200 hours, and to
8750	leave a margin of safety, the site made sure they were out by 0900. The
8751	physics team had planted chronotropic sensors at various points along
8752	the paths and walkways between the Tombs, both to alert the monitors to
8753	variations of the tides and to warn the visitors.
8754	With only three weeks to go of her year of research on Hyperion, Rachel
8755	awoke one night, left her sleeping lover, and took a ground effect jeep
8756	from the camp to the Tombs. She and Melio had decided that it was
8757	foolish for both of them to monitor the equipment every night; now they
8758	alternated, one working at the site while the other collated data and
8759	prepared for the final project - a radar
8760	mapping of the dunes between the Jade Tomb and the Obelisk.
8761	The night was cool and beautiful. A profusion of stars stretched from
8762	horizon to horizon, four or five times the number Rachel had grown up
8763	looking at from Barnard's World. The low dunes whispered and shifted in
8764	the strong breeze blowing from the mountains in the south.
8765	Rachel found lights still burning at the site. The physics team was
8766	just calling it a day loading their own jeep.
8767	She chatted with them, had a cup of coffee as they drove away, and then
8768	took her backpack and made the twenty-five-minute trip into the basement
8769	of the Sphinx.
8770	For the hundredth time Rachel wondered who had built the Tombs and for
8771	what purpose. Dating of the construction materials had been useless
8772	because of the effect of the anti-entropic field. Only analysis of the
8773	Tombs in relation to the erosion of the canyon and other surrounding
8774	geological features had suggested an age of at least half a million
8775	years. The feeling was that the architects of the Time Tombs had been
8776	humanoid, even though nothing but the gross scale of the structures
8777	suggested such a thing. Certainly the passageways in the Sphinx
8778	revealed little: some were human enough in size and shape, but then
8779	meters farther along the same corridor might dwindle to a tube the size
8780	of a sewer pipe and then transform itself into something larger and more
8781	random than a natural cavern. Doorways, if they could be called such
8782	since they opened to nothing in particular, might be triangular or
8783	trapezoidal or ten-sided as commonly as rectangular.
8784	Rachel crawled the last twenty meters down a steep slope, sliding her
8785	backpack ahead of her. The heatless glow-globes gave the rock and her
8786	flesh a bluish, bloodless cast. The 'basement,' when she reached it,
8787	seemed a haven of human clutter and smells. Several folding chairs
8788	filled the center of the small space while detectors, oscilloscopes, and
8789	other paraphernalia lined the narrow table against the north wall. A
8790	plank on sawhorses along the opposite wall held coffee cups, a chess
8791	set, a half-eaten doughnut, two paperbacks, and a plastic toy of some
8792	sort of dog in a grass skirt.
8793	Rachel settled in, set her coffee therm next to the toy, and checked the
8794	cosmic ray detectors. The data appeared to be the same: no hidden rooms
8795	or passages, just a few niches even the deep radar had missed. In the
8796	morning Melio and Stefan would set a deep probe working, getting an
8797	imager filament in and sampling the air before digging further with a
8798	micro-manipulator. So far a dozen such niches had turned up nothing of
8799	interest. The joke at camp was that the next hole, no bigger than a
8800	fist, would reveal miniature sarcophagi, undersized urns, a petite
8801	mummy, or- as Melio put it- 'a teeny-tiny Tutankhamen."
8802	Out of habit, Rachel tried the comm links on her comlog. Nothing. Forty
8803	meters of stone tended to do that. They had talked of stringing
8804	telephone wire from the basement to the surface, but there had been no
8805	pressing need and now their time was almost up. Rachel adjusted the
8806	input channels on her cornlog to monitor the detector data and then
8807	settled back for a long, boring night.
8808	There. was the wonderful story of the Old Earth pharaoh- was it
8809	Cheops?- who authorized his huge pyramid, agreed to the burial chamber
8810	being deep under the center of the thing, and then lay awake nights for
8811	years in a claustrophobic panic, thinking of all those tons of stone
8812	above him for all eternity. Eventually the pharaoh ordered the burial
8813	chamber repositioned two thirds the way up the great pyramid. Most
8814	unorthodox.
8815	Rachel could understand the king's position. She hoped that - wherever
8816	he was - he slept better now.
8817	Rachel was almost dozing herself when - at 02I5 -her comlog chirped, the
8818	detectors screamed, and she jumped to her feet. According to the
8819	sensors, the Sphinx had suddenly grown a dozen new chambers, some larger
8820	than the total structure. Rachel keyed displays and the air misted with
8821	models that changed as she watched.
8822	Corridor schematics twisted back on themselves like rotating MObius
8823	strips. The external sensors indicated the upper structure twisting and
8824	bending like polyfiex in the wind - or like wings.
8825	Rachel knew that it was some type of multiple malfunction, but even as
8826	she tried to recalibrate she called data and impressions into her
8827	comlog. Then several things happened at once.
8828	She heard the drag of feet in the corridor above her.
8829	All of the displays went dead simultaneously.
8830	Somewhere in the maze of corridors a time-tide alarm began to blare.
8831	All of the lights went off.
8832	This final event made no sense. The instrument packages held their own
8833	power supplies and would have stayed lit through a nuclear attack. The
8834	lamp they used in the basement had a new ten-year power cell. The
8835	glow-globes in the corridors were bioluminescent and needed no power.
8836	Nonetheless, the lights were out. Rachel pulled a flashlight laser out
8837	of the knee pocket of her jumpsuit and triggered it. Nothing happened.
8838	For the first time in her life, terror closed on Rachel Weintraub like a
8839	hand on her heart. She could not breathe. For ten seconds she willed
8840	herself to be absolutely still, not even listening, merely waiting for
8841	the panic to recede. When it had subsided enough for her to breathe
8842	without gasping, she felt her way to the instruments and keyed them.
8843	They did not respond. She lifted her comlog and thumbed the diskey.
8844	Nothing... which was impossible, of course, given the solid-state
8845	invul-nerability and power-cell reliability of the thing. Still,
8846	nothing.
8847	Rachel could hear her pulse pounding now but she again fought back the
8848	panic and began feeling her way toward the only exit. The thought of
8849	finding her way through the maze in absolute darkness made her want to
8850	scream but she could think of no other alternatives.
8851	Wait. There had been old lights throughout the Sphinx maze but the
8852	research team had strung the glow-globes.
8853	Strung them. There was a perIon line connecting them all the way to the
8854	surface.
8855	Fine. Rachel groped her way toward the exit, feeling the cold stone
8856	under her fingers. Was it this cold before?
8857	There came the clear sound of something sharp scraping its way down the
8858	access shaft.
8859	'Melio?" called Rachel into the blackness. 'Tanya?
8860	Kurt?"
8861	The scraping sounded very close. Rachel backed away, knocking over an
8862	instrument and chair in the blackness. Something touched her hair and
8863	she gasped, raised her hand.
8864	The ceiling was lower. The solid block of stone, five meters square,
8865	slid lower even as she raised her other hand to touch it. The opening
8866	to the corridor was halfway up the wall. Rachel staggered toward it,
8867	swinging her hands in front of her like a blind person. She tripped
8868	over a folding chair, found the instrument table, followed it to the far
8869	wall, felt the bottom of the corridor shaft disappearing as the ceiling
8870	came lower. She pulled back her fingers a second before they were
8871	sliced off.
8872	Rachel sat down in the darkness. An oscilloscope scraped against the
8873	ceiling until the table cracked and collapsed under it. Rachel moved
8874	her head in short, desperate arcs. There was a metallic rasp - almost a
8875	breathing sound - less than a meter from her. She began to back away,
8876	sliding across a floor suddenly filled with broken equipment. The
8877	breathing grew louder.
8878	Something sharp and infinitely cold grasped her wrist.
8879	Rachel screamed at last.
8880	There was no fatline transmitter on Hyperion in those days. Nor did the
8881	spinship HS Farraux City have FTL-comm capability. So the first Sol and
8882	Sarai heard of their daughter's accident was when the Hegemony consulate
8883	on Parvati fatlined the college that Rachel had been injured, that she
8884	was stable but unconscious, and that she was being transferred from
8885	Parvati to the Web world of Renaissance Vector via medical torchship.
8886	The trip would take a little over ten days' shiptime with a five-month
8887	time-debt. Those five months were agony for Sol and his wife, and by
8888	the time the medical ship put in at the Renaissance farcaster nexus,
8889	they had imagined the worst a thousand times. It had been eight years
8890	since they had last seen Rachel.
8891	The Med Center in DaVinci was a floating tower sustained by direct
8892	broadcast power. The view over the
8893	Como Sea was breathtaking but neither Sol nor Sarai had time for it as
8894	they went from level to level in search of their daughter. Dr Singh and
8895	Melio Arundez met them in the
8896	hub of Intensive Care. Introductions were rushed.
8897	'Rachel?" asked Sarai.
8898	'Asleep,' said Dr Singh. She was a tall woman, aristocratic but with
8899	kind eyes. 'As far as we can tell, Rachel has suffered no physical...
8900	ah... injury. But she has been unconscious now for some seventeen
8901	standardweeks, her time. Only in the past ten days have her brain waves
8902	registered deep sleep rather than coma."
8903	' I don't understand,' said Sol."Was there an accident at the site? A
8904	concussion?"
8905	'Something happened,' said Melio Arundez, 'but we're not sure what.
8906	Rachel was in one of the artifacts... alone · . . her comlog and
8907	other instruments recorded nothing out of the ordinary. But there was a
8908	surge in a phenomenon there known as anti-entropic fields..."
8909	'The time tides,' said Sol. 'We know about them.
8910	Go on. '
8911	Arundez nodded and opened his hands as if molding air. 'There was a...
8912	field surge... more like a tsunami than a tide... the Sphinx... the
8913	artifact Rachel was in · . . was totally inundated. I mean, there was
8914	nophysical damage but Rachel was unconscious when we found her · . ."
8915	He turned to Dr Singh for help.
8916	'Your daughter was in a coma,' said the doctor. 'It was not possible to
8917	put her into cryogenic fugue in that condition..."
8918	'So she came through quantum leap without fugue?" demanded Sol. He had
8919	read about the psychological damage to travelers who had experienced the
8920	Hawking effect directly.
8921	'No, no,' soothed Singh. 'She was unconscious in a way
8922	which shielded her quite as well as fugue state."
8923	'Is she hurt?" demanded Sarai.
8924	'We don't know,' said Singh 'All life signs have returned to near
8925	normal. Brain-wave activity is nearing a conscious state. The problem
8926	is that her body appears to have absorbed... that is, the anti-entropic
8927	field appears to have contaminated her."
8928	Sol rubbed his forehead. 'Like radiation sickness?" Dr Singh hesitated.
8929	'Not precisely... ah... this case is quite unprecedented. Specialists
8930	in aging diseases are due in this afternoon from Tau Ceti Center, Lusus,
8931	and Metaxas."
8932	Sol met the woman's gaze. 'Doctor, are you saying that Rachel
8933	contracted some aging disease on Hyperion?" He paused a second to search
8934	his memory. 'Something like Methuselah syndrome or early Alzheimer's
8935	disease?"
8936	'No,' said Singh, 'in fact your daughter's illness has no name. The
8937	medics here are calling it Merlin's sickness.
8938	You see . . . your daughter is aging at a normal rate ... but as far
8939	as we can tell, she is aging backward."
8940	Sarai pulled away from the group and stared at Singh as if the doctor
8941	were insane. 'I want to see my daughter,'
8942	she said, quietly but very firmly. 'I want to see Rachel
8943	tO W. '
8944	Rachel awakened less than forty hours after Sol and Saral arrived.
8945	Within minutes she was sitting up in bed, talking even while the medics
8946	and technicians bustled around her. 'Morn! Dad! What are you doing
8947	here?" Before either could answer, she looked around her and blinked.
8948	'Wait a minute, where's here? Are we in Keats?"
8949	Her mother took her hand. 'We're in a hospital in DaVinci, dear. On
8950	Renaissance Vector."
8951	Rachel's eyes widened almost comically. 'Renaissance.
8952	We're in the Web?" She looked around her in total bewilderment.
8953	'Rachel, what is the last thing you remember?" asked Dr Singh.
8954	The young woman looked uncomprehendingly at the medic. 'The last thing
8955	I... I remember going to sleep next to Melio after..." She glanced at
8956	her parents and touched her cheeks with the tips of her fingers. 'Melio?
8957	The others? Are they..."
8958	'Everyone on the expedition is all right,' soothed Dr Singh. 'You had a
8959	slight accident. About seventeen weeks have passed. You're back in the
8960	Web. Safe. Everyone in your party is all right."
8961	'Seventeen weeks..." Under the fading remnant of her tan, Rachel went
8962	very pale.
8963	Sol took her hand. 'How do you feel, kiddo?" The return pressure on his
8964	fingers was heartbreakingly weak.
8965	'I don't know, Daddy,' she managed. 'Tired. Dizzy.
8966	Confused."
8967	Sarai sat on the bed and put her arms around her. 'It's all fight,
8968	baby. Everything's going to be all right."
8969	Melio entered the room, unshaven, his hair rumpled from the nap he had
8970	been taking in the outer lounge.
8971	'Rache?"
8972	Rachel looked at him from the safety of her mother's arm. 'Hi,' she
8973	said, almost shyly. 'l'm back."
8974	SoI's opinion had been and continued to be that medicine hadn't really
8975	changed much since the days of leeches and poultices; nowadays they
8976	whirred one in centrifuges, realigned the body's magnetic field;
8977	bombarded the victim with sonic waves, tapped into the cells to
8978	interrogate the RNA, and then admitted their ignorance without actually
8979	coming out and saying so. The only thing that had changed was that the
8980	bills were bigger.
8981	He was dozing in a chair when Rachel's voice awoke him.
8982	'Daddy?"
8983	He sat up, reached for her hand. 'Here, kiddo." 'Where am I, Dad?
8984	What's happened?"
8985	'You're in a hospital on Renaissance, baby. There was an accident on
8986	Hyperion. You're all right now except it's affecting your memory a
8987	bit."
8988	Rachel clung to his hand. 'A hospital? In the Web?
8989	How'd Iget here? How long have I been here?"
8990	'About five weeks,' whispered Sol. 'What's the last thing you remember,
8991	Rachel?"
8992	She sat back on her pillows and touched her forehead, feeling the tiny
8993	sensors there. 'Melio and I had been at the meeting. Talking with the
8994	team about setting up the search equipment in the Sphinx. Oh ... Dad
8995	... I haven't told you about Melio... he's..."
8996	'Yes,' said Sol and handed Rachel her comiog. 'Here, kiddo. Listen to
8997	this." He left the room.
8998	Rachel touched the diskey and blinked as her own voice began talking to
8999	her. 'OK, Rache, you just woke up. You're confused. You don't know
9000	how you got here.
9001	Well, something's happened to you, kid. Listen up.
9002	'I'm recording this on the twelfth day of Tenmonth, year 457 of the
9003	Hegira, A.D. 2739 old reckoning. Yes, I know that's half a standard
9004	year from the last thing you remember. Listen.
9005	'Something happened in the Sphinx. You got caught up in the time tide.
9006	It changed you. You're aging backward, as dumb as that sounds. Your
9007	body's getting younger every minute, although that's not the important
9008	part right now. When you sleep... when we sleep...
9009	you forget. You lose another day from your memory before the accident,
9010	and you lose everything since. Don't ask me why. The doctors don't
9011	know. The experts don't know. If you want an analogy, just think of a
9012	tapeworm virus... one of the old kind... that's chewing up the data in
9013	your comlog... backward from the last entry.
9014	'They don't know why the memory loss hits you when you sleep, either.
9015	They tried stay-awakes, but after about thirty hours you just go
9016	catatonic for a while and the virus does its thing anyway. So what the
9017	hell.
9018	'You know something? This talking about yourself in the third person is
9019	sort of therapeutic. Actually, I'm lying here waiting for them to take
9020	me up to imaging, knowing I'll fall asleep when I get back... knowing
9021	VII forget everything again . . . and it scares the shit out of me.
9022	'OK, key the diskey for short-term and you get a prepared spiel here
9023	that should catch you up on everything since the accident. Oh... Mom
9024	and Dad are both here and they know about Melio. But/don't know as much
9025	as I used to. When did we first make love with him, mmm?
9026	The second month on Hyperion? Then we have just a few weeks left,
9027	Rachel, and then we'll be just acquain tances. Enjoy your memories
9028	while you can, girl.
9029	'This is yesterday's Rachel, signing off."
9030	Sol came in to find his daughter sitting upright in the bed, still
9031	grasping the comlog tightly, her face pale and terrified. 'Daddy..."
9032	He went to sit next to her and let her cry... for the twentieth night
9033	in a row.
9034	Eight standard weeks after she arrived on Renaissance, Sol and Sarai
9035	waved goodbye to Rachel and Melio at the Da Vinci farcaster multiport
9036	and then farcast home to Barnard's World.
9037	'l don't think she should have left the hospital,' muttered Sarai as
9038	they took the evening shuttle to Crawford.
9039	The continent was a patchwork of harvest-ready right angles below them.
9040	'Mother,' said Sol, touching her knee, 'the doctors would have kept her
9041	there forever. But they're doing it for their own curiosity now.
9042	They've done everything they can to help her... nothing. She has a
9043	life to live."
9044	'But why go away with... with him?" said Sarai. 'She barely knows
9045	him."
9046	Sol sighed andJeaned back against the cushions of his seat. 'In two
9047	weeks she won't remember him at all,' he said. 'At least in the way
9048	they share now. Look at it from her position, Mother. Fighting every
9049	day to reorient herself in a world gone mad. She's twenty-five years
9050	old and in love. Let her be happy."
9051	Sarai turned her face to the window and together, not speaking, they
9052	watched the red sun hang like a tethered balloon on the edge of evening.
9053	Sol was well into the second semester when Rachel called. It was a
9054	one-way message via farcaster cable from Freeholm and her image hung in
9055	the center of the old holopit like a familiar ghost.
9056	'Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Sorry I haven't written or called the past few
9057	weeks. I guess you know that i've left the university. And Melio. It
9058	was dumb to try to take new graduate-level stuff. I'd just forget
9059	Tuesday whatever was discussed Monday. Even with disks and comlog
9060	prompts it was a losing battle. I may enroll in the undergraduate
9061	program again . . . I remember all of it! Just kidding.
9062	'It was just too hard with Melio, too. Or so my notes tell me. It
9063	wasn't his fault, I'm sure of that. He was
9064	gentle and patient and loving to the end. It's just that·..
9065	well, you can't start from scratch on a relationship every day. Our
9066	apartment was filled with photos of us, notes I wrote to myself about
9067	us, holos of us on Hyperion, but . . you know. In the morning he
9068	would be an absolute stranger. By afternoon I began to believe what
9069	we'd had, even if I couldn't remember. By evening I'd be crying in his
9070	arms... then, sooner or later, I'd go to sleep. It's better this way."
9071	Rachel's image paused, turned as if she was going to break contact, and
9072	then steadied. She smiled at them.
9073	'So anyway, I've left school for a while. The Freeholm Med Center wants
9074	me full time but they'd have to get in line... I got an offer from the
9075	Tau Ceti Research Institute that's hard to turn down. They offer a... I
9076	think they call it a "research honorarium" . . . that's bigger than
9077	what we paid for four years at Nightenhelser and all of Reichs combined.
9078	'I turned them down. I'm still going in as an outpatient, but the RNA
9079	transplant series just leaves me with bruises and a depressed feeling.
9080	Of course, I could just be depressed because every morning I can't
9081	remember where the bruises came from. Ha-ha.
9082	'Anyway, I'II be staying with Tanya for a while and then maybe... I
9083	thought maybe I'd come home for a while. Secondmonth's my birthday...
9084	I'll be twenty-two again. Weird, huh? At any rate, it's a lot easier
9085	being around people I know and I met Tanya just after I transferred here
9086	when I was twenty-two ... I think you understand.
9087	'So... is my old room still here, Mom, or have you turned it into a
9088	mah-jongg parlor like you've always threatened? So write or give me a
9089	call. Next time l'll shell out the money for two-way so we can really
9090	talk. I just · . . I guess I thought..."
9091	Rachel waved. 'Gottago. See you later, alligators. I love you both."
9092	Sol flew to Bussard City the week before Rachel's birthday to pick her
9093	up at the world's only public farcaster terminex. He saw her first,
9094	standing with her luggage
9095	near the floral clock. She looked young but not noticeably younger than
9096	when they had waved goodbye on Renaissance Vector. No, Sol realized,
9097	there was something less confident about her posture. He shook his head
9098	to rid himself of such thoughts, called to her, and ran to hug her.
9099	The look of shock on her face when he released her was so profound that
9100	he could not ignore it. 'What is it, sweetie? What's wrong?"
9101	It was one of the few times he had ever seen his daughter totally at a
9102	loss for words.
9103	'I... you... I forgot,' she stammered. She shook her head in a
9104	familiar way and managed to laugh and cry at the same instant. 'You
9105	look a little different is all, Dad. I remember leaving here like it
9106	was... literally... yesterday.
9107	When I saw... your hair..." Rachel covered her mouth.
9108	Sol ran his hand across his scalp. 'Ah, yes,' he said, suddenly close
9109	to laughing and crying himself. 'With your school and travels, it's
9110	been more than eleven years. I'm old. And bald." He opened his arms
9111	again. 'Welcome back, little one."
9112	Rachel moved into the protective circle of his embrace.
9113	For several months things went well. Rachel felt more secure with
9114	familiar things around, and for Sarai the heartbreak of their daughter's
9115	illness was temporarily offset by the pleasure of having her home again.
9116	Rachel rose early every morning and viewed her private 'orientation
9117	show' which, Sol knew, contained images of him and Sarai a dozen years
9118	older than she remembered.
9119	He tried to imagine what it was like for Rachel: she awoke in her own
9120	bed, memory fresh, twenty-two years old, home on vacation before going
9121	offworld to graduate school, only to find her parents suddenly aged, a
9122	hundred small changes in the house and town, the news different · . .
9123	years of history having passed her by.
9124	Sol could not imagine it.
9125	Their first mistake was acceding to Rachel's wishes in inviting her old
9126	friends to her twenty-second birthday party: the same crew who had
9127	celebrated the first
9128	time- irrepressible Niki, Don Stewart and his friend Howard, Kathi Obeg
9129	and Marta Tyn, her best friend Linna McKyler - all of them then just out
9130	of college, shucking off cocoons of childhood for new lives.
9131	Rachel had seen them all since her return. But she had slept... and
9132	forgotten. And Sol and Sarai this one time did not remember that she
9133	had forgotten.
9134	Niki was thirty-four standard, with two children of her own - still
9135	energetic, still irrepressible, but ancient by Rachel's standards. Don
9136	and Howard talked about their investments, their children's sports
9137	accomplishments, and their upcoming vacations. Kathi was confused,
9138	speaking only twice to Rachel and then as if she was speaking to an
9139	impostor. Marta was openly jealous of Rachel's youth. Linna, who had
9140	become an ardent Zen Gnostic in the years between, cried and left early.
9141	When they had gone, Rachel sat in the postparty ruin of the living room
9142	and stared at the half-eaten cake. She did not cry. Before going
9143	upstairs she hugged her mother and whispered to her father, 'Dad, please
9144	don't let me do anything like that again."
9145	Then she went upstairs to sleep.
9146	It was that spring when Sol again had the dream. He was lost in a
9147	great, dark place, lighted only by two red orbs. It was not absurd when
9148	the flat voice said:
9149	'Sol. Take your daughter, your only Rachel, whom you love, and go to
9150	the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering at one
9151	of the places of which I shall tell you."
9152	And Sol had screamed into the darkness:
9153	'You already have her, you son of a bitch! What do I have to do to get
9154	her back? Tell me! Tell me, goddamn you!'
9155	And Sol Weintraub woke sweating with tears in his eyes and anger in his
9156	heart. In the other room he could feel his daughter sleeping while the
9157	great worm devoured her.
9158	In the months which followed Sol became obsessive about obtaining
9159	information on Hyperion, the Time Tombs, and the Shrike. As a trained
9160	researcher, he was astounded that there were so little hard data on so
9161	provocative a topic. There was the Church of the Shrike, of course -
9162	there were no temples on Barnard's World but many in the Web - but he
9163	soon found that seeking hard information in Shrike cult literature was
9164	like trying to map the geography of Sarnath by visiting a Buddhist
9165	monastery. Time was mentioned in Shrike Church dogma, but only in the
9166	sense that the Shrike was supposed to be '... the Angel of Retribution
9167	from Beyond Time' and that true time had ended for the human race when
9168	Old Earth died and that the four centuries since had been 'false time."
9169	Sol found their tracts the usual combination of double talk and navel
9170	lint-gathering common to most religions. Still, he planned to visit a
9171	Shrike Church temple as soon as he had explored more serious avenues of
9172	research.
9173	Melio Arundez launched another Hyperion expedition, also sponsored by
9174	Reichs University, this one with the stated goal of isolating and
9175	understanding the time-tide phenomenon which had inflicted the Merlin
9176	sickness on Rachel. A major development was the Hegemony Protectorate's
9177	decision to send along on that expedition a fatline transmitter for
9178	installation at the Hegemony consulate in Keats. Even so, it would be
9179	more than three years' Web time before the expedition arrived on
9180	Hyperion. SoI's first instinct was to go with Arundez and his team -
9181	certainly any holodrama would have the primary characters returning to
9182	the scene of the action. But Sol overrode the instinctive urge within
9183	minutes. He was a historian and philosopher; any contribution he might
9184	make to the expedition's success would be minute, at best. Rachel still
9185	retained the interest and skills of a we!l-trained undergraduate
9186	archaeologist-to-be, but those skills dwindled a bit each day and Sol
9187	could see no benefit to her returning to the site of the accident. Each
9188	day would be a shock to her, awakening on a strange world, on a mission
9189	which would require skills unknown to her.
9190	Sarai would not allow such a thing.
9191	Sol set aside the book he was working on - an analysis of Kierkegaard's
9192	theories of ethics as compromise morality as applied to the legal
9193	machinery of the Hegemony - and concentrated on collecting arcane data
9194	on time, on Hyperion, and on the story of Abraham.
9195	Months spent carrying on business as usual and collecting information
9196	did little to satisfy his need for action. Occasionally he vented his
9197	frustration on the medical and scientific specialists who came to
9198	examine Rachel like streams of pilgrims to a holy shrine.
9199	'How the hell can this be happening!" he screamed at one little
9200	specialist who had made the mistake of being both smug and condescending
9201	to the patient's father.
9202	The doctor had a head so hairless, his face looked like lines painted on
9203	a billiard ball. 'She's begun growing smaller!" Sol shouted, literally
9204	buttonholing the retreating expert. 'Not so one can see, but bone mass
9205	is decreasing. How can she even begin to become a child again? What
9206	the hell does that do to the law of conservation of mass?"
9207	The expert had moved his mouth but had been too rattled to speak. His
9208	bearded colleague answered for him. 'M. Weintranb,' he said, 'sir. You
9209	have to understand that your daughter is currently inhabiting... ah ·..
9210	think of it as a localized region of reversed entropy."
9211	Sol wheeled on the other man. 'Are you saying that she is merely stuck
9212	in a bubble of backwardness?"
9213	'Ah... no,' said the colleague, massaging his chin nervously. 'Perhaps
9214	a better analogy is that ...
9215	biologically at least... the life/metabolism mechanism has been
9216	reversed... ah..."
9217	'Nonsense,' snapped Sol. 'She doesn't excrete for nutrition or
9218	regurgitate her food. And what about all the neurological activity?
9219	Reverse'the electrochemical impulses and you get nonsense. Her brain
9220	works, gentlemen ... it's her memory that is disappearing. Why,
9221	gentlemen? Why?"
9222	The specialist finally found his voice. 'We don't know why, M.
9223	Weintraub. Mathematically, your daughter's body resembles a
9224	time-reversed equation... or perhaps an object which has passed through
9225	a rapidly spinning
9226	black hole· We don't know how this has happened or why the physically
9227	impossible is occurring in this instance, M. Weintraub. We just don't
9228	know enough."
9229	Sol shook each man's hand. 'Fine. That's all I wanted to know,
9230	gentlemen. Have a good trip back." +
9231	On Rachel's twenty-first birthday she came to Sol's door an hour after
9232	they had all turned in. 'Daddy?"
9233	'What is it, kiddo?" Sol pulled on his robe and joined her in the
9234	doorway. 'Can't sleep?"
9235	'I haven't slept for two days,' she whispered. 'Been taking stay-awakes
9236	so I can get through all of the brief ing stuff I left in the Wanta
9237	Know? file."
9238	Sol nodded.
9239	'Daddy, would you come downstairs and have a drink with me? I've got
9240	some things I want to talk about."
9241	Sol got his glasses from the nightstand and joined her downstairs.
9242	It proved to be the first and only time that Sol would get drunk with
9243	his daughter. It was not a boisterous drunk- for a while they chatted,
9244	then began telling jokes and making puns, until each was giggling too
9245	hard to continue. Rachel started to tell another story, sipped her
9246	drink just at the funniest part, and almost snorted whiskey out her
9247	nose, she was laughing so hard. Each of them thought it was the
9248	funniest thing that had ever happened.
9249	'I'll get another bottle,' said Sol when the tears had ceased. 'Dean
9250	Moore gave me some Scotch last Christmas...
9251	I think."
9252	When he returned, walking carefully, Rachel had sat up on the couch and
9253	brushed her hair with her fingers.
9254	He poured her a small amount and the two drank in
9255	silence for a while.
9256	'Daddy?" 'Yes?"
9257	'I went through the whole thing. Saw myself, listened to myself, saw
9258	the holos of Linna and the others all middle-aged..."
9259	'Hardly middle-aged,' said Sol. 'Liana will be thirty-five next
9260	month..."
9261	'Well, old, you know what ! mean, Anyway, I read the medical briefs,
9262	saw the photos from Hyperion, and
9263	you know what?"
9264	'What?"
9265	'I don't believe any of it, Dad."
9266	Sol put down his drink and looked at his daughter.
9267	Her face was fuller than before, less sophisticated. And even more
9268	beautiful.
9269	'I mean, I do believe it,' she said with a small, scared laugh. 'It's
9270	not like you and Mom would put on such a cruel joke. Plus there's
9271	your... your age... and the news and all. I know it's real, but I
9272	don't believe it. Do
9273	you know what I mean, Dad?"
9274	'Yes,' said Sol.
9275	'I mean I woke up this morning and I thought, Great . . . tomorrow's
9276	the paleontology exam and l've hardly studied. I was looking forward to
9277	showing Roger Sherman a thing or two... he thinks he's so smart."
9278	Sol took a drink. 'Roger died three years ago in a plane crash south of
9279	Bussard,' he said. He would not have spoken without the whiskey in him,
9280	but he had to find out if there was a Rachel hiding within the Rachel.
9281	'I know,' said Rachel and pulled her knees up to her chin. 'I accessed
9282	everybody I knew. Gram's dead. Professor Eikhardt isn't teaching
9283	anymore. Niki married some... salesman. A lot happens in four years."
9284	'More than eleven years,' said Sol. 'The trip to and from Hyperion left
9285	you six years behind us stay-at-homes."
9286	'But that's normal,' cried Rachel. 'People travel outside the Web all
9287	the time. They cope."
9288	Sol nodded. 'But this is different, kiddo."
9289	Rachel managed a smile and drained the last of her whiskey. 'Boy, what
9290	an understatement." She set the glass down with a sharp, final sound.
9291	'Look, here's what l've decided. I've spent two and a half days going
9292	through all of the stuff she... !... prepared to let me know what's
9293	happened, what's going on... and #just doesn't help."
9294	Sol sat perfectly still, not even daring to breathe.
9295	'I mean,' said Rachel, 'knowing that I'm getting
9296	younger every day, losing the memory of people I haven't even met yet...
9297	I mean, what happens next? I just keep getting younger and smaller and
9298	less capable until I just disappear someday? Jesus, Dad." Rachel
9299	wrapped her arms more tightly around her knees. 'It's
9300	sort of funny in a weird way, isn't it?"
9301	'No,' Sol said quietly.
9302	'No, I'm sure it's not,' said Rachel. Her eyes, always large and dark,
9303	were moist. 'It must be the worst nightmare in the world for you and
9304	Morn. Every day you have to watch me come down the stairs . . .
9305	confused . . .
9306	waking up with yesterday's memories but hearing my own voice tell me
9307	that yesterday was years ago. That I
9308	had a love affair with some guy named Areclio..." 'Melio,' whispered
9309	Sol.
9310	'Whatever. It just doesn't help, Dad. By the time I can even begin to
9311	absorb it, I'm so worn out that I have to sleep. Then... well, you
9312	know what happens then."
9313	'What ..." began Sol and had to clear his throat.
9314	'What do you want us to do, little one?"
9315	Rachel looked him in the eye and smiled. It was the same smile she had
9316	gifted him with since her fifth week of life. 'Don't tell me, Dad,' she
9317	said firmly. 'Don't let me tell me. It just hurts. I mean, I didn't
9318	live those times
9319	' She paused and touched her forehead. 'You know vit I mean, Dad. The
9320	Rachel who went to another planet and fell in love and got hurt ... that
9321	was a different Rachel! I shouldn't have to suffer her pain." She was
9322	crying now. 'Do you understand? Do you?"
9323	'Yes,' said Sol. He opened his arms and felt her warmth and tears
9324	against his chest. 'Yes, I understand."
9325	Fatline messages from Hyperion came frequently the next year but they
9326	were all negative. The nature and source of the anti-entropic fields
9327	had not been found.
9328	No unusual time-tide activity had been measured around the Sphinx.
9329	Experiments with laboratory animals in and around the tidal regions had
9330	resulted in sudden death for some animals, but the Merlin sickness had
9331	not been replicated. Melio ended every message with 'My love to
9332	Rachel."
9333	Sol and Sarai used money loaned from Reichs University to receive
9334	limited Poulsen treatments in Bussard City. They were already too old
9335	for the process to extend their lives for another century, but it
9336	restored the look of a couple approaching fifty standard rather than
9337	seventy.
9338	They studied old family photos and found that it was not too difficult
9339	to dress the way they had a decade and a half before.
9340	Sixteen-year-old Rachel tripped down the stairs with her comlog tuned to
9341	the college radio station. 'Can I have rice cereal?"
9342	'Don't you have it every morning?" smiled Sarai.
9343	'Yes,' grinned Rachel. 'I just thought we might be out
9344	or something. I heard the phone. Was that Niki?" 'No,' said Sol.
9345	'Damn,' said Rachel and glanced at them. 'Sorry. But she promised
9346	she'd call as soon as the standardized scores came in. Three weeks
9347	since tutorials. You'd think l'd have heard something."
9348	'Don't worry,' said Sarai. She brought the coffeepot to the table,
9349	started to pour Rachel a cup, poured it for herself. 'Don't worry,
9350	honey. I promise you that your scores will be good enough to get you
9351	into any school you want."
9352	'More,' sighed Rachel. 'You don't know. It's a dog-eat-dog world out
9353	there." She frowned. 'Have you seen my math ansible? My room was all
9354	messed around. I couldn't find anything."
9355	Sol cleared his throat. 'No classes today, kiddo."
9356	Rachel stared. 'No classes? On a Tuesday? Six weeks from graduation?
9357	What's up?"'
9358	'You've been sick,' Sarai said firmly. 'You can stay home one day. Just
9359	today."
9360	Rachel's frown deepened. 'Sick? I don't feel sick. Just sort of
9361	weird. Like things aren't... aren't right somehow.
9362	Like why's the couch moved around in the media room? And where's Chips?
9363	I called and called but he didn't come."
9364	Sol touched his daughter's wrist. 'You've been sick for a while,' he
9365	said. 'The doctor said you might wake
9366	up with a few gaps. Let's talk while we walk over to the campus. Want
9367	to?"
9368	Rachel brightened. 'Skip classes and go to the college?
9369	Sure." She faked a look of consternation. 'As long as we don't run into
9370	Roger Sherman. He's taking freshman calculus up there and he's such a
9371	pain."
9372	'We won't see Roger,' said Sol. 'Ready to go?"
9373	'Almost." Rachel leaned over and gave her mother a huge hug. ' 'Later
9374	alligator."
9375	' 'While, crocodile,' said Sarai.
9376	'Okay,' grinned Rachel, her long hair bouncing. 'l'm ready."
9377	The constant trips to Bussard City had required the purchase of an EMV
9378	and on a cool day in autumn Sol took the slowest route, far below the
9379	traffic lanes, enjoying the sight and smell of the harvested fields
9380	below. More than a few men and women working in the fields waved to
9381	him.
9382	Bussard had grown impressively since Sol's childhood, but the synagogue
9383	was still there on the edge of one of the oldest neighborhoods in the
9384	city. The temple was old, Sol felt old, even the yarmulke he put on as
9385	he entered seemed ancient, worn thin by decades of use, but the rabbi
9386	was young. Sol realized that the man was at least forty - his hair was
9387	thinning on either side of the dark skullcap - but to Sol's eyes he was
9388	little more than a boy. Sol was relieved when the younger man suggested
9389	that they finish their conversation in the park across the street.
9390	They sat on a park bench. Sol was surprised to find himself still
9391	carrying the yarmulke, passing the cloth from hand to hand. The day
9392	smelled of burning leaves and the previous night's rain.
9393	'I don't quite understand, M. Weintraub,' said the rabbi. 'Is it the
9394	dream you're disturbed about or the fact that your daughter has become
9395	ill since you began the dream?"
9396	Sol raised his head to feel the sunlight on his face.
9397	'Neither, exactly,' he said. 'I just can't help but feel that the two
9398	are connected somehow."
9399	The rabbi ran a finger over his lower lip. 'How old is your daughter?"
9400	'Thirteen,' said Sol after an imperceptible pause.
9401	'And is the illness... serious? Life threatening?" 'Not life
9402	threatening,' said Sol. 'Not yet."
9403	The rabbi folded his arms across an ample belly. 'You
9404	don't believe... may I call you Sol?"
9405	'Of course."
9406	'Sol, you don't believe that by having this dream...
9407	that somehow you've caused your little girl's illness.
9408	Do you?"
9409	'No,' said Sol and sat a moment, wondering deep within if he was telling
9410	the truth. 'No, Rabbi, I don't think..."
9411	'Call me Mort, Sol."
9412	'All right, Mort. I didn't come because I believe that I - or the dream
9413	- am causing Rachel's illness. But I believe my subconscious might be
9414	trying to tell me something."
9415	Mort rocked back and forth slightly. 'Perhaps a neuro-specialist or
9416	psychologist could help you more there, Sol. I'm not sure what I..."
9417	'I'm interested in the story of Abraham,' interrupted Sol. 'I mean,
9418	I've had some experience with different ethical systems, but it's hard
9419	for me to understand one which began with the order to a father to slay
9420	his son."
9421	'No, no, no!" cried the rabbi, waving oddly childlike fingers in front
9422	of him. 'When the time came, God stayed Abraham's hand. He would not
9423	have allowed a human sacrifice in His name. It was the obedience to the
9424	will of the Lord that..."
9425	'Yes,' said Sol. 'Obedience. But it says, "Then Abraham put forth his
9426	hand, and took the knife to slay his son." God must have looked into his
9427	soul and seen that Abraham was ready to slay Isaac. A mere show of
9428	obedience without inner commitment would not have appeased the God of
9429	Genesis. What would have happened if Abraham had loved his son more
9430	than he loved .God?"
9431	Mort drummed his fingers on his knee a moment and then reached out to
9432	grasp Sol's upper arm. 'Sol, I can see
9433	you're upset about your daughter's illness. Don't get it mixed up with
9434	a document written eight thousand years ago. Tell me more about your
9435	little girl. I mean, children don't die of diseases anymore. Not in
9436	the Web."
9437	Sol rose, smiled, and stepped back to free his arm. 'I'd like to talk
9438	more, Mort. I want to. But I have to get back.
9439	I have a class this evening."
9440	'Will you come to temple this Sabbath?" asked the rabbi, extending
9441	stubby fingers for a final human contact.
9442	Sol dropped the yarmulke into the younger man's hands. 'Perhaps one of
9443	these days, Mort. One of these days I will."
9444	Later the same autumn Sol looked out the window of his study to see the
9445	dark figure of a man standing under the bare elm in front of the house.
9446	The media, thought Sol, his heart sinking. For a decade he had been
9447	dreading the day the secret got out, knowing it would mean the end of
9448	their simple life in Crawford. He walked out into the evening chill.
9449	'Melio!" he said when he saw the tall man's face.
9450	The archaeologist stood with his hands in the pockets of his long blue
9451	coat. Despite the ten standard years since their last contact, Arundez
9452	had aged but little -Sol guessed that he was still in his late twenties.
9453	But the younger man's heavily tanned face was lined with worry. 'Sol,'
9454	he said and extended his hand almost shyly.
9455	Sol shook his hand warmly. 'I didn't know you were back. Come into the
9456	house."
9457	'No." The archaeologist took a half step back. 'I've been out here for
9458	an hour, Sol. I didn't have the courage to come to the door."
9459	Sol started to speak but then merely nodded. He put his hands in his
9460	own pockets against the chill. The first stars were becoming visible
9461	above the dark gables of the house. 'Rachel's not home right now,' he
9462	said at last.
9463	'She went to the library. She . . . she thinks she has a history
9464	paper due."
9465	Melio took a ragged breath and nodded in return.
9466	'Sol,' he said, his voice thick, 'you and Sarai need to understand that
9467	we did everything we could. The team was on Hyperion for almost three
9468	standard years. We would have stayed if the university hadn't cut our
9469	funds.
9470	There was nothing..."
9471	'We know,' said Sol. 'We appreciated the fatline messages."
9472	'I spent months alone in the Sphinx myself,' said Melio. 'According to
9473	the instruments, it was just an inert pile of stones, but sometimes I
9474	thought I felt... something .... ' He shook his head again. 'I failed
9475	her, Sol."
9476	'No,' said Sol and gripped the younger man's shoulder through the wool
9477	coat. 'But I have a question. We've been in touch with our senators...
9478	even talked to the Science Council directors; . . but no one can
9479	explain to me why the Hegemony hasn't spent more time and money
9480	investigating the phenomena on Hyperion. It seems to me that they
9481	should have invested that world into the Web long ago, if only for its
9482	scientific potential.
9483	How can they ignore an enigma like the Tombs?"
9484	'I know what you mean, Sol. Even the early cutoff of our funds was
9485	suspicious. It's as if the Hegemony had a policy to keep Hyperion at
9486	arm's length."
9487	'Do you think . . ." began Sol but at the moment Rachel approached
9488	them in the autumn twilight. Her hands were thrust deep in her red
9489	jacket, her hair was cut short in the decades-old style of adolescents
9490	everywhere, and her full cheeks were flushed with the cold. Rachel was
9491	teetering on the brink of childhood and young adulthood; her long legs
9492	in jeans, sports shoes, and bulky jacket might have been the silhouette
9493	of a boy.
9494	,. She grinned at them. 'Hi, Dad." Stepping closer in the dim light,
9495	she nodded at Melio shyly. 'Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt your
9496	conversation."
9497	Sol took a breath. 'That's all right, kiddo. Rachel, this is Dr
9498	Arundez from Reichs University on Freeholm.
9499	Dr Arundez, my daughter Rachel."
9500	'Pleased to meet you,' said Rachel, beaming in earnest now. 'Wow,
9501	Reichs. I've read their catalogues. I'd love to go there someday."
9502	Melio nodded rigidly. Sol could see the stiffness in his
9503	shoulders and torso. 'Do you..." began Melio. 'That is, what would you
9504	like to study there?"
9505	Sol thought the pain in the man's voice must be audible to Rachel but
9506	she only shrugged and laughed.
9507	'Oh, jeez, everything. Old Mr Eikhardt- he's the
9508	paleontology/archaeology tute in the advanced class I take up at the Ed
9509	Center - he says they have a great
9510	classics and ancient artifacts department."
9511	'They do,' managed Melio.
9512	Rachel glanced shyly from her father to the stranger, apparently sensing
9513	the tension there but not knowing the source. 'Well, l'm just
9514	interrupting your conversation more here. l've got to get in and get to
9515	bed. I guess I've had this strange virus... sort of like meningitis,
9516	More says, only it must make me sort of goofy. Anyway, nice to meet
9517	you, Dr Arundez. I hope I'll see you at Reichs someday. '
9518	'I hope that too,' said Melio, staring at her so intensely in the gloom
9519	that Sol had the feeling he was trying to memorize everything about the
9520	instant.
9521	'Okay, well . . ." said Rachel and stepped back, her rubber-soled
9522	shoes squeaking on the sidewalk, 'good
9523	night, then. See you in the morning, Dad."
9524	'Good night, Rachel."
9525	She paused at the doorway. The gaslight on the lawn made her look much
9526	younger than thirteen. ' 'Later, alligators."
9527	' 'While, crocodile,' said Sol and heard Melio whisper it in unison.
9528	They stood awhile in silence, feeling the night settle on the small
9529	town. A boy on a bicycle rode by, leaves crackling under his wheels,
9530	spokes gleaming in the pools of light under the old streetlamps. 'Come
9531	in the house,' Sol said to the silent man. 'Sarai will be very pleased
9532	to see you. Rachel will be asleep."
9533	'Not now,' said Melio. He was a shadow there, his hands still in his
9534	pockets. 'I need to... it was a mistake, Sol." He started to turn
9535	away, looked back. 'I'!I phone when I get to Freeholm,' he said. 'We'll
9536	get another expedition put together."
9537	Sol nodded. Three years transit, he thought. If they
9538	left tonight she wouM be... not quite ten before they arrive. 'Good,'
9539	he said.
9540	Melio paused, raised a hand in farewell, and walked away along the curb,
9541	ignoring the leaves that crunched underfoot.
9542	Sol never saw him in person again.
9543	The largest Church of the Shrike in the Web was on Lusus and Sol farcast
9544	there a few weeks before Rachel's tenth birthday. The building itself
9545	was not much larger than an Old Earth cathedral, but it seemed gigantic
9546	with its effect of flying buttresses in search of a church, twisted
9547	upper stories, and support walls of stained glass.
9548	Sol's mood was low and the brutal Lusian gravity did nothing to lighten
9549	it. Despite his appointment with the bishop, Sol had to wait more than
9550	five hours before he was allowed into the inner sanctum. He spent most
9551	of the time staring at the slowly rotating twenty-meter, steel and
9552	polychrome sculpture which might have been of the legendary Shrike . .
9553	. and might have been an abstract homage to every edged weapon ever
9554	invented.
9555	What interested Sol the most were the two red orbs floating within the
9556	nightmare space which might have been a skull.
9557	'M. Weintraub?"
9558	'Your Excellency,' said Sol. He noticed that the acolytes, exorcists,
9559	!ectors, and ostiaries who had kept him company during the long wait had
9560	prostrated themselves on the dark tiles at the high priest's entry. Sol
9561	managed a formal bow.
9562	'Please, please, do come in, M. Weintraub,' said the priest. He
9563	indicated the doorway to the Shrike sanctuary with a sweep of his robed
9564	arm.
9565	Sol passed through, found himself in a dark and echoing place not too
9566	dissimilar from the setting of his recurrent dream, and took a seat
9567	where the bishop indicated. As the cleric moved to his own place at
9568	what looked like a small throne behind an intricately carved but
9569	thoroughly modern desk, Sol noticed that the high priest was a native
9570	Lusian, gone to fat and heavy in the jowls, but formidable in the way
9571	all Lusus residents
9572	seemed to be. His robe was striking in its redness... a bright,
9573	arterial red, flowing more like a contained liquid than like silk or
9574	velvet, trimmed in onyx ermine. The bishop wore a large ring on each
9575	finger and they alternated red and black, producing a disturbing effect
9576	in Sol.
9577	'Your Excellency,' began Sol, 'I apologize in advance for any breach in
9578	church protocol which I have committed...
9579	or may commit. I confess I.know little about the Church of the Shrike,
9580	but what I do know has brought me here. Please forgive me if I
9581	inadvertently display my ignorance by my clumsy use of titles or terms."
9582	The bishop wiggled his fingers at Sol. Red and black stones flashed in
9583	the weak light. 'Titles are unimportant, M. Weintraub. Addressing us
9584	as "Your Excellency" is quite acceptable for a nonbeliever. We must
9585	advise you, however, that the formal name of our modest group is the
9586	Church of the Final Atonement and the entity whom the world so blithely
9587	calls... the Shrike... we refer to · . . if we take His name at
9588	all... as the Lord of Pain or, more commonly, the Avatar. Please
9589	proceed with the important query you said you had for us."
9590	Sol bowed slightly. 'Your Excellency, I am a teacher..."
9591	'Excuse us for interrupting, M. Weintraub, but you are much more than a
9592	teacher. You are a scholar. We are very familiar with your writings on
9593	moral hermeneutics.
9594	The reasoning therein is flawed but quite challenging.
9595	We use it regularly in our courses in doctrinal apologetics.
9596	Please proceed."
9597	Sol blinked. His work was almost unknown outside the most rarefied
9598	academic circles and this recognition had thrown him. In the five
9599	seconds it took him to recover, Sol found it preferable to believe that
9600	the Shrike bishop wanted to know with whom he spoke and had an excellent
9601	staff. 'Your Excellency, my background is immaterial. I asked to see
9602	you because my child... my .daughter... has taken ill as a possible
9603	result of research she was carrying out in an area which is of some
9604	importance to your Church. I speak, of course, of the so-called Time
9605	Tombs on the world of Hyperion."
9606	The bishop nodded slowly. Sol wondered if he knew about Rachel.
9607	'You are aware, M. Weintraub, that the area you referred to . . .
9608	what we call the Covenant Arks . . .
9609	has recently been declared off limits to so-called researchers by the
9610	Home Rule Council of Hyperion?"
9611	'Yes, Your Excellency. I have heard that. I understand that your
9612	Church was instrumental in that legislation being passed."
9613	The bishop showed no response to this. Far off in the incense-layered
9614	gloom, small chimes sounded 'At any rate, Your Excellency, I hoped that
9615	some aspect of your Church's doctrine might shed light on my daughter's
9616	illness."
9617	The bishop inclined his head forward so that the single shaft of light
9618	which illuminated him gleamed on his forehead and cast his eyes into
9619	shadow. 'Do you wish to receive religious instruction in the mysteries
9620	of the Church, M. Weintraub?"
9621	Sol touched his beard with a finger. 'No, Your Excellency, unless in so
9622	doing I might improve the wellbeing of my daughter."
9623	'And does your daughter wish to be initiated into the Church of the
9624	Final Atonement?"
9625	Sol hesitated a beat. 'Again, Your Excellency, she wishes to be well.
9626	If joining the Church would heal or help her, it would be a very serious
9627	consideration."
9628	The bishop sat back in a rustle of robes. Redness seemed to flow from
9629	him into the gloom. 'You speak of physical wellbeing, M. Weintraub.
9630	Our Church is the final arbiter of spiritual salvation. Are you aware
9631	that the former invariably flows from the latter?"
9632	'I am aware that this is an old and widely respected proposition,' said
9633	Sol. 'The total wellbeing of our daughter is the concern of my wife and
9634	myself."
9635	The bishop rested his massive head on his fist. 'What is the nature of
9636	your daughter's illness, M. Weintraub?" 'It is... a time-related
9637	illness, Your Excellency."
9638	The bishop sat forward, suddenly tense. 'And at which of the holy sites
9639	did you say your daughter contracted this malady, M. Weintraub?"
9640	'The artifact called the Sphinx, Your Excellency." The bishop stood so
9641	quickly that papers on his desktop were knocked to the floor. Even
9642	without the robes, the man would have massed twice Sol's weight. In the
9643	fluttering red robes, stretched to his full height, the Shrike priest
9644	now towered over Sol like crimson death incarnate. 'You can go!"
9645	bellowed the big man. 'Your daughter is the most blessed and cursed of
9646	individuals.
9647	There is nothing that you or the Church . . . or any agent in this
9648	life... can do for her."
9649	Sol stood . . . or, rather, sat . . . his ground. 'Your
9650	Excellency, if there is any possibility..."
9651	'NO!" cried the bishop, red in the face now, a consummately consistent
9652	apparition. He tapped at his desk.
9653	Exorcists and lectors appeared in the doorway, their black robes with
9654	red trim an ominous echo of the bishop. The all-black ostiaries blended
9655	with the shadows.
9656	'The audience is at an end,' said the bishop with less volume but
9657	infinite finality. 'Your daughter has been chosen by the Avatar to
9658	atone in a way which all sinners and nonbelievers must someday suffer.
9659	Someday very soon."
9660	'Your Excellency, if I can have just five minutes more of your time..."
9661	The bishop snapped his fingers and the exorcists came forward to escort
9662	Sol out. The men were Lusian. One of them could have handled five
9663	scholars Sol's size.
9664	'Your Excellency..." cried Sol after he had shrugged off the first man's
9665	hands. The three other exorcists came to assist with the equally brawny
9666	lectors hovering nearby. The bishop had turned his back and seemed to
9667	be staring into the darkness.
9668	The outer sanctuary echoed to grunts and the scraping of Sol's heels and
9669	to at least one loud gasp as Sol's foot made contact with the least
9670	priestly parts of the lead exorcist. The outcome of the debate was not
9671	affected.
9672	Sol landed in the street. The last ostiary to turn away tossed Sol's
9673	battered hat to him.
9674	Ten more days on Lusus achieved nothing but more gravity fatigue for
9675	Sol. The Temple bureaucracy would not answer his calls. The courts
9676	could offer him no
9677	wedge. The exorcists waited just within the doors of the vestibule.
9678	Sol farcast to New Earth and Renaissance Vector, to Fuji and TC2, to
9679	Deneb Drei and Deneb Vier, but everywhere the Shrike temples were closed
9680	to him.
9681	Exhausted, frustrated, out of money, Sol 'cast home to Barnard's World,
9682	got the EMV out of the long-term lot, and arrived home an hour before
9683	Rachel's birthday.
9684	'Did you bring me anything, Daddy?" asked the excited ten-year-old.
9685	Sarai had told her that day that Sol had been gone.
9686	Sol brought out the wrapped package. It was the collected Anne of Green
9687	Gables series. It was not what
9688	he had wanted to bring her.
9689	'Can I open it?"
9690	'Later, little one. With the other things."
9691	'Oh, please, Dad. Just one thing now. Before Niki and the other kids
9692	get here?"
9693	Sol caught Sarai's eye. She shook her head. Rachel remembered inviting
9694	Niki and Linna and her other friends to the party only days before.
9695	Sarai had not yet come up with an excuse.
9696	'All right, Rachel,' he said. 'Just this one before the party."
9697	While Rachel ripped into the small package, Sol saw the giant package in
9698	the living room, secured with red ribbon. The new bike, of course.
9699	Rachel had asked for the new bike for a year before her tenth birthday.
9700	Sol tiredly wondered if she would be surprised tomorrow to find the new
9701	bike here the day before her tenth birthday.
9702	Or perhaps they would get rid of the bike that night, while Rachel
9703	slept.
9704	Sol collapsed onto the couch. The red ribbon reminded him of the
9705	bishop's robes.
9706	Sarai had never had an easy time of surrendering the past. Every time
9707	she cleaned and folded and put away a set of Rachel's outgrown baby
9708	clothes, she had shed secret tears that Sol somehow knew about. Sarai
9709	had treasured every stage of Rachel's childhood, enjoying the day-to-day
9710	normaIcy of things; a normaIcy which
9711	she quietly accepted as the best of life. She had always felt that the
9712	essence of human experience lay not primarily in the peak experiences,
9713	the wedding days and triumphs which stood out in the memory like dates
9714	circled in red on old calendars, but, rather, in the unsetf-conscious
9715	flow of little things - the weekend afternoon with each member of the
9716	family engaged in his or her own pursuit, their crossings and
9717	connections casual, dialogues imminently forgettable, but the sum of
9718	such hours creating a synergy which was important and eternal.
9719	Sol found Sarai in the attic, weeping softly as she went through boxes.
9720	These were not the gentle tears once shed for the ending of small
9721	things. Sarai Weintraub was angry.
9722	'What are you doing, Mother?"
9723	'Rachel needs clothes. Everything is too big. What fit on an
9724	eight-year-old won't fit a seven-year-old. I have some more of her
9725	things here somewhere."
9726	'Leave it,' said Sol. 'We'll buy something new." Sarai shook her head.
9727	'And have her wonder every day where all of her favorite clothes have
9728	gone? No. I've
9729	saved some things. They're here somewhere."
9730	'Do it later."
9731	'Damn it, there/s no later!" shouted Sarai and then turned away from Sol
9732	and raised her hands to her face.
9733	'I'm sorry."
9734	Sol put his arms around her. Despite the limited Poulsen treatments,
9735	her bare arms were much thinner than he remembered. Knots and cords
9736	under rough skin.
9737	He hugged her tightly.
9738	'l'm sorry,' she repeated, sobbing openly now. 'It's just not fair."
9739	'No,' agreed Sol. 'It's not fair." The sunlight coming through the
9740	dusty attic panes had a sad, cathedral quality to it. Sol had always
9741	loved the smell of an attic - the hot and stale promise of a place so
9742	underused and filled with future treasures. Today it was ruined.
9743	He crouched next to a box. 'Come, dear,' he said, 'we'll look
9744	together."
9745	Rachel continued to be happy, involved with life, only slightly confused
9746	by the incongruities which faced her each morning when she awoke. As
9747	she grew younger it became easier to explain away the changes that
9748	appeared -to have occurred overnight - the old elm out front gone, the
9749	new apartment building on the corner where M.
9750	Nesbitt used to live in a colonial-era home, the absence of her friends
9751	- and Sol began to see as never before the flexibility of children. He
9752	now imagined Rachel living on the breaking crest of the wave of time,
9753	not seeing the murky depths of the sea beyond, keeping her balance with
9754	her small store of memories and a total commitment to the twelve to
9755	fifteen hours of now allowed her each day.
9756	Neither Sol nor Sarai wanted their daughter isolated from other children
9757	and it was difficult to find ways to make contact. Rachel was delighted
9758	to play with the 'new girl' or 'new boy' in the neighborhood - children
9759	of other instructors, the grandchildren of friends, for a while with
9760	Niki's daughter - but the other children had to grow accustomed to
9761	Rachel greeting them anew each day, remembering nothing of their common
9762	past, and only a few had the sensitivity to continue such a charade for
9763	the sake of a playmate.
9764	The story of Rachel's unique illness was no secret in Crawford, of
9765	course. The fact of it had spread through the college the first year of
9766	Rachel's return and the entire town knew soon after. Crawford reacted
9767	in the fashion of small towns immemorial- some tongues wagged
9768	constantly, some people could not keep the pity and pleasure at someone
9769	else's misfortune out of their voices and gazes - but mostly the
9770	community folded its protective wings around the Weintraub family like
9771	an awkward mother bird shielding its young.
9772	Still, they were allowed to live their lives, and even when Sol had to
9773	cut back classes and then take an early retirement because of trips
9774	seeking medical treatment for Rachel, the real reason was mentioned by
9775	no one.
9776	But it could not last, of course, and on the spring day when Sol stepped
9777	onto the porch and saw his weeping seven-year-old daughter coming back
9778	from the park
9779	surrounded and followed by a pack of newsteeps, their camera implants
9780	gleaming and cornlogs extended, he knew that a phase of their life was
9781	over forever. Sol jumped from the porch and ran to Racbel's side.
9782	'M. Weintraub, is it true that your daughter contracted a terminal time
9783	illness? What's going to happen in seven years? Will she just
9784	disappear?"
9785	'M. Weintraub! M. Weintraub! Rachel says that she thinks Raben
9786	Dowell is Senate CEO and this is the year A.D. 27II. Has she lost
9787	those thirty-four years completely or is this a delusio, caused by the
9788	Merlin sickness?"
9789	'Rachel! Do you remember being a grown woman?
9790	What's it feel like to be a kid again?"
9791	'M. Weintraub! M. Weintraub! Just one still image, please. How
9792	about you get apicture of Rachel when she was older and you and the kid
9793	stand looking at it?"
9794	'M. Weintraub! Is it true that this is the curse of the Time Tombs?
9795	Did Rachel see the Shrike monster?"
9796	'Hey, Weintraub! Sol! Hey, Solly! What're you and the little woman
9797	going to do when the kid's gone?"
9798	There was a newsteep blocking Sol's way to the front door. The man
9799	leaned forward, the stereo lenses of his eyes elongating as they zoomed
9800	in for a close-up of Rachel. Sol grabbed the man's long hair - which
9801	was conveniently tied in a queue - and flung him aside.
9802	The pack brayed and bellowed outside the house for seven weeks. Sol
9803	realized what he had known and forgotten about very small communities:
9804	they were frequently annoying, always parochial, sometimes prying on a
9805	one-to-one level, but never had they subscribed to the vicious legacy of
9806	the so-called 'public's right to know."
9807	The Web did. Rather than have his family become permanent prisoners to
9808	the besieging reporters, Sol went on the offensive. He arranged
9809	interviews on the most pervasive farcaster cable news programs,
9810	participated in All Thing discussions, and personally attended the
9811	Concourse Medical Research Conclave. In ten standard months he asked
9812	for help for his daughter on eighty worlds.
9813	Offers poured in from ten thousand sources but the bulk of the
9814	communications were from faith healers, project promoters, institutes
9815	and free-lance researchers offering their services in exchange for the
9816	publicity, Shrike cultists and other religious zealots pointing out that
9817	Rachel deserved the punishment, requests from various advertising
9818	agencies for product endorsements, offers from media agents to 'handle'
9819	Rachel for such endorsements, offers of sympathy from common people -
9820	frequently enclosing credit chips, expressions of disbelief from
9821	scientists, offers from holie producers and book publishers for
9822	exclusive rights to Rachel's life, and a barrage of real estate offers.
9823	Reichs University paid for a team of evaluators to sort the offers and
9824	see if anything might benefit Rachel.
9825	Most of the communications were discarded. A few medical or research
9826	offers were seriously considered. In the end, none seemed to offer any
9827	avenue of research or experimental therapy which Reichs had not already
9828	tried. One fatline flimsy came to Sol's attention. It was from the
9829	Chairman of Kibbutz K'far Shalom on Hebron and read simply:
9830	IF IT BECOMES' TOO MUCH, COME.
9831	It soon became too much. After the first few months of publicity the
9832	siege seemed to lift, but this was only the prelude to the second act.
9833	Faxsimmed tabloids referred to Sol as the 'Wandering Jew,' the desperate
9834	father wandering afar in search of a cure for his child's bizarre
9835	illness- an ironic title given Sol's lifelong dislike of travel. Sarai
9836	inevitably was 'the grieving mother." Rachel was 'the doomed child' or,
9837	in one inspired headline, 'Virgin Victim of the Time Tombs' Curse." None
9838	of the family could go outside without finding a newsteep or imager
9839	hiding behind a tree.
9840	Crawford discovered that there was money to be found in the Weintraubs'
9841	misfortune. At first the town held the line, but when entrepreneurs
9842	from Bussard City moved in with gift shops, T-shirt concessions, tours,
9843	and datachip booths for the tourists who were coming in larger and
9844	larger numbers, the local business people first dithered, then wavered,
9845	then decided unanimously that, if t here was commerce to be carried on,
9846	the profits should not go to outsiders.
9847	After four hundred and thirty-eight standard years of comparative
9848	solitude, the town of Crawford received a farcaster terminex. No longer
9849	did visitors have to suffer the twenty-minute flight from Bussard City.
9850	The crowds grew.
9851	On the day they moved it rained heavily and the streets were empty.
9852	Rachel did not cry, but her eyes were very wide all day and she spoke in
9853	subdued tones. It was ten days before
9854	her sixth birthday." But, Daddy, why do we have to move?" 'We just do,
9855	honey." 'But why?"
9856	'It's something we have to do, little one. You'll like Hebron. There
9857	are lots of parks there."
9858	'But how come you never saidwe were going to move?" 'We did, sweetie.
9859	You must have forgotten."
9860	'But what about Gram and Grams and Uncle Richard
9861	and Aunt Tetha and Uncle Saul and everybody?"
9862	'They can come visit us any time."
9863	'But what about Niki and Linna and my friends?"
9864	Sol said nothing but carried the last of the luggage to the EMV. The
9865	house was sold and empty; furniture had been sold or sent ahead to
9866	Hebron. For a week there had been a steady stream of family and old
9867	friends, college associates, and even some of the Reichs reed team who
9868	had worked with Rachel for eighteen years, but now the street was empty.
9869	Rain streaked the Perspex canopy of the old EMV and ran in complex
9870	rivulets. The three of them sat in the vehicle for a moment, staring at
9871	the house. The interior smelled of wet wool and wet hair.
9872	Rachel clutched the teddy bear Sarai had resurrected from the attic six
9873	months earlier. She said,' It's not fair."
9874	'No,' agreed Sol." It's not fair."
9875	Hebron was a desert world. Four centuries of terra-forming had made the
9876	atmosphere breathable and a few million acres of land arable. The
9877	creatures which had lived
9878	there before were small and tough and infinitely wary, and so were the
9879	creatures imported from Old Earth, including the human kind.
9880	'Ahh,' gasped Sol the day they arrived in the sun-baked village of Dan
9881	above the sun-baked ibbutz of K'far Shalom, 'what masochists we Jews
9882	are. Twenty thousand surveyed worlds fit for our kind when the Hegira
9883	began, and those schmucks came here."
9884	But it was not masochism which brought either the first colonists or Sol
9885	and his family. Hebron was mostly desert, but the fertile areas were
9886	almost frighteningly fertile. Sinai University was respected throughout
9887	the Web and its Med Center brought in wealthy patients and a healthy
9888	income for the cooperative. Hebron had a single farcaster terminex in
9889	New Jerusalem and allowed portals nowhere else. Belonging to neither
9890	the Hegemony nor Protectorate, Hebron taxed travelers heavily for
9891	farcaster privilege and allowed no tourists outside New Jerusalem. For
9892	a Jew seeking privacy, it was perhaps the safest place in three hundred
9893	worlds trod by man.
9894	The kibbutz was more a cooperative by tradition than in operation. The
9895	Weintraubs were welcomed to their own home - a modest place offering
9896	sun-dried adobe, curves instead of right angles, and bare wood floo o,
9897	b.".
9898	also offering a view from the hill which showed an infinite expanse of
9899	desert beyond the orange and olive groves. The sun seemed to dry up
9900	everything, thought Sol, even .worries and bad dreams. The light was a
9901	physical thing. In the evening their house glowed pink for an hour
9902	after the sun had set.
9903	Each morning Sol sat by his daughter's bed until she awoke. The first
9904	minutes of her confusion were always painful to him, but he made sure
9905	that he was the first thing Rachel saw each day. He held her while she
9906	asked her questions.
9907	'Where are we, Daddy?"
9908	'In a wonderful place, little one. I'll tell you all about it over
9909	breakfast."
9910	'How did we get here?"
9911	'By 'casting and flying and walking a bit,' he would say. 'It's not so
9912	far away... but far enough to make it an adventure."
9913	'But my bed's here... my stuffed animals... why don't I remember
9914	coming?"
9915	And Sol would hold her gently by the shoulders and look into her brown
9916	eyes and say, 'You had an accident, Rachel. Remember in The Homesick
9917	Toad where Terrence hits his head and forgets where he lives for a
9918	few days? It was sort of like that."
9919	'Am I better?"
9920	'Yes,' Sol would say, 'you're all better now." And the house would fill
9921	with the smell of breakfast and they would go out to the terrace where
9922	Sarai waited.
9923	Rachel had more playmates than ever. The kibbutz cooperative had a
9924	school where she was always the welcomed visitor, greeted anew each day.
9925	In the long afternoons the children played in the orchards and explored
9926	along the cliffs.
9927	Avner, Robert, and Ephraim, the Council elders, urged Sol to work on his
9928	book. Hebron prided itself on the number of scholars, artists,
9929	musicians, philosophers, writers and composers it sheltered as citizens
9930	and long-term residents. The house, they pointed out, was a gift of the
9931	state. Sol's pension, though small by We,b standards, was more than
9932	adequate for their modest needs in K'far Shalom. To Sol's surprise,
9933	however, he found that he enjoyed physical labor. Whether working in
9934	the orchards or clearing stones in the unclaimed fields or repairing a
9935	wall above the city, Sol found that his mind and spirit were freer than
9936	they had been in many years. He discovered that he could wrestle with
9937	Kierkegaard while he waited for mortar to dry and find new insights in
9938	Kant and Vandeur while carefully checking the apples for worms. At the
9939	age of seventy-three standard, Sol earned his first calluses.
9940	In the evenings he would play with Rachel and then take a walk in the
9941	foothills with Sarai as Judy or one of the other neighbor girls watched
9942	their sleeping child.
9943	One weekend they went away to New Jerusalem, just Sol
9944	and Sarai, the first time they had been alone together for that long
9945	since Rachel returned to live with them seventeen standard years before.
9946	But everything was not idyllic. Too frequent were the nights when Sol
9947	awoke alone and walked barefoot down the hall to see Sarai watching over
9948	Rachel in her sleep.
9949	And often at the end of a long day, bathing Rachel in the old ceramic
9950	tub or tucking her in as the walls glowed pinkly, the child would say,
9951	'I like it here, Daddy, but can we go home tomorrow?" And Sol would nod.
9952	And after the good-night story, and the lullaby, and the good-night
9953	kiss, sure that she was asleep, he would begin to tiptoe out of the room
9954	only to hear the muffled · 'Later, alligator' from the blanketed form on
9955	the bed, to which he had to reply ' 'While, crocodile." And lying in bed
9956	himself, next to the softly breathing and possibly sleeping length of
9957	the woman he loved, Sol would watch the strips of pale light from one or
9958	both of Hebron's small moons move across the rough walls and he would
9959	talk to God.
9960	Sol had been talking to God for some months before he realized what he
9961	was doing. The idea amused him. The dialogues were in no way prayers
9962	but took the form of angry monologues which - just short of the point
9963	where they became aliatribes- became vigorous arguments with himself.
9964	Only not just with himself. Sol realized one day that the topics of the
9965	heated debates were so profound, the stakes to be settled so serious,
9966	the ground covered so broad, that the only person he could possibly be
9967	berating for such shortcomings was God Himself.
9968	Since the concept of a personal God, lying awake at night worrying about
9969	human beings, intervening in the lives of individuals, always had been
9970	totally absurd to Sol, the
9971	thought of such dialogues made him doubt his sanity.
9972	But the dialogues continue,'
9973	Sol wanted to know how an 'ical system - much less a religion so
9974	indomitable that it t,td survived every evil mankind could throw at it-
9975	could flow from a command from God for a man to slaughter his on. It
9976	did not matter to Sol that the command had been rescinded at the last
9977	moment. It did not matter that the command was a test of obedience. In
9978	fact, the idea that it was the obedience of Abraham which allowed him to
9979	become the father of all the tribes of Israel was precisely what drove
9980	Sol into fits of fury.
9981	After fifty-five years of dedicating his life and work to the story of
9982	ethical systems, Sol Weintraub had come to a single, unshakable
9983	conclusion: any allegiance to a deity or concept or universal principle
9984	which put obedience above decent behavior toward an innocent human being
9985	was evil.
9986	- So define 'innocent'?. came the vaguely amused, faintly
9987	querulous voice which Sol associated with these arguments.
9988	--A child is innocent, thought Sol. Isaac was.
9989	Rachel is.
9990	- 'Innocent' by the mere fact of being a child?
9991	- Yes.
9992	- And there is no situation where the blood of the innocent must
9993	be shed for a greater cause?
9994	- No, thought Sol. None.
9995	- But the 'innocent' are not restricted to children, I presume.
9996	- Sol hesitated, sensing a trap, trying to see where his
9997	subconscious interlocutor was heading. He could not. No, he thought,
9998	the 'innocent' include others as well as children.
9999	- Such as Rachel? At age twenty-four? The innocent shouM not
10000	be sacrificed at any age?
10001	- That's right.
10002	--Perhaps this is part of the lesson which Abraham needed to learn
10003	before he could be
10004	father to the blessed of the nations of the earth.
10005	--What lesson? thought Sol. What lesson? But
10006	the voice in his mind had faded and now there were only the sounds of
10007	night birds outside and the soft breathing of his wife beside him.
10008	Rachel could still read at age five. Sol had trouble remembering when
10009	she had learned to read - it seemed
10010	she always had been able to. 'Four standard,' said Sarai.
10011	'It was early summer... three months after her birthday.
10012	We were picnicking in the field above the college, Rachel was looking at
10013	her Winnie-the-Pooh book, and
10014	suddenly she said, "I hear a voice in my head"."
10015	Sol remembered then.
10016	He also remembered the joy he and Sarai had felt at the rapid
10017	acquisition of new skills Rachel had shown at that age. He remembered
10018	because now they were confronted with the reverse of that process.
10019	'Dad,' said Rachel from where she lay on the floor of his study,
10020	carefully coloring, 'how long has it been since Mom's birthday?"
10021	'It was on Monday,' said Sol, preoccupied with something he was reading.
10022	Sarai's birthday had not yet come but Rachel remembered it.
10023	'I know. But how long has it been since then?"
10024	'Today is Thursday,' said Sol. He was reading a long Talmudic treatise
10025	on obedience.
10026	'I know. But how many days?"
10027	Sol put down. the hard copy. 'Can you name the days of the week?"
10028	Barnard's World had used the old calendar.
10029	'Sure,' said Rachel. 'Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
10030	Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday..." 'You said Saturday
10031	already." 'Yeah. But how many days ago?"
10032	'Can you count from Monday to Thursday?"
10033	Rachel frowned, moved her lips. She tried again, counting on her
10034	fingers this time. 'Four days?"
10035	'Good,' said Sol. 'Can you tell me what ten minus four is, kiddo?"
10036	'What does minus mean?"
10037	Sol forced himself to look at his papers again.
10038	'Nothing,' he said. 'Something you'll learn at school."
10039	'When we go home tomorrow?"
10040	'Yes."
10041	One morning when Rachel went off with Judy to play with the other
10042	children - she was too young to attend school any longer - Sarai said:
10043	'Sol, we have to take her to Hyperion."
10044	Sol stared at her. 'What?"
10045	'You heard me. We can't wait until she is too young to walk... to
10046	talk. Also, we're not getting any younger." Sarai barked a mirthless
10047	laugh. 'That sounds strange, doesn't it? But we're not. The Poulsen
10048	treatments will be wearing off in a year or two."
10049	'Sarai, did you forget? The doctors all say that Rachel could not
10050	survive cryogenic fugue. No one experiences FTL travel without fugue
10051	state. The Hawking effect can drive one mad... or worse."
10052	'It doesn't matter,' said Sarai. 'Rachel has to return to Hyperion."
10053	'What on earth are you talking about?" said Sol, angered.
10054	Sarai gripped his hand. 'Do you think you're the only
10055	one who has had the dream?"
10056	'Dream?" managed Sol.
10057	She sighed and sat at the white kitchen table. Morning light struck the
10058	plants on the sill like a yellow spotlight.
10059	'The dark place,' she said. 'The red lights above. The voice. Telling
10060	us to... telling us to take... to go to Hyperion. To make... an
10061	offering."
10062	Sol licked his lips but there was no moisture there.
10063	His heart pounded. 'Whose name... whose name is called?"
10064	Sarai looked at him strangely. 'Both of our names. If you weren't
10065	there... in the dream with me... I could never have borne it all these
10066	years."
10067	Sol collapsed into his chair. He looked down at the strange hand and
10068	forearm lying on the table. The knuckles of the hand were beginning to
10069	enlarge with arthritis; the forearm was heavily veined, marked with
10070	liver spots.
10071	It was his hand, of course. He heard himself say: 'You never mentioned
10072	it. Never said a word..."
10073	This time Sarai's laugh was without bitterness. 'As if I had to! All
10074	those times both of us coming awake in the dark. And you covered with
10075	sweat. I knew from the first time that it was not merely a dream. We
10076	have to go, Father. Go to Hyperion."
10077	Sol moved the hand. It still did not feel a part of him.
10078	'Why? For God's sake, why, Sarai? We can't... offer Rachel..."
10079	'Of course not, Father. Haven't you thought about this? We have to go
10080	to Hyperion . . . to wherever the dream tells us to go... and offer
10081	ourselves instead."
10082	'Offer ourselves,' repeated Sol. He wondered if he was having a heart
10083	attack. His chest ached so terribly that he could not take in a breath.
10084	He sat for a full minute in silence, convinced that if he attempted to
10085	utter a word only a sob would escape. After another minute he said:
10086	'How long have you . . . thought about this, Mother?"
10087	'Do you mean known what we must do? A year. A little more. Just after
10088	her fifth birthday."
10089	'A year! Why haven't you said something?"
10090	'I was waiting for you. To realize. To know."
10091	Sol shook his head. The room seemed far away and slightly tilted. 'No.
10092	I mean, it doesn't seem... I have to think, Mother." Sol watched as the
10093	strange hand patted Sarai's familiar hand.
10094	She nodded.
10095	Sol spent three days and nights in the arid mountains, eating only the
10096	thick-crusted bread he had brought and drinking from his condenser
10097	therm.
10098	Ten thousand times in the past twenty years he had wished that he could
10099	take Rachel's illness; that if anyone had to suffer it should be the
10100	father, not the child. Any parent would feel that way - did feel that
10101	way every time his child lay injured or racked with fever. Surely it
10102	could not be that simple.
10103	In the heat of the third afternoon, as he lay half dozing in the shade
10104	of a thin tablet of rock, Sol learned that it was not that simple.
10105	Can that be Abraham's answer to God? That he would be the offering, not
10106	Isaac?
10107	It could have been Abraham's. It cannot be yours.
10108	Why?
10109	As if in answer, Sol had the fever-vision of naked adults filing toward
10110	the ovens past armed men, mothers hiding their children under piles of
10111	coats. He saw' men and women with flesh hanging in burned strips
10112	carrying the dazed children from the ashes of what once had been a city.
10113	Sol knew that these images were no dreams, were the very stuff of the
10114	First and Second Holocausts, and in his understanding knew before the
10115	voice spoke in his mind what the answer was. What it must be.
10116	The parents have offered themselves. That sacrifice already has been
10117	accepted. We are beyond that.
10118	Then what? What!
10119	Silence answered him. Sol stood in the full glare of the sun, almost
10120	fell. A black bird wheeled overhead or in his vision. Sol shook his
10121	fist at the gunmetal sky.
10122	You use Nazis as your instruments. Madmen.
10123	Monsters. You're a goddamn monster yourself.
10124	mtqo.
10125	The earth tilted and Sol fell on his side against sharp rocks. He
10126	thought that it was not unlike leaning against a rough wall. A rock the
10127	size of his fist burned his cheek.
10128	The correct answer for Abraham was obedience, thought Sol. Ethically,
10129	Abraham was a child himself. All men were at that time. The correct
10130	answer for Abraham's children was to become adults and to offer
10131	themselves instead.
10132	What is the correct answer for us?
10133	There was no answer. The ground and sky quit spinning.
10134	After a while Sol rose shakily, rubbed the blood and grit from his
10135	cheek, and walked down to the town in the valley below.
10136	'No,' Sol told Sarai, 'we will not go to Hyperion. It is not the
10137	correct solution."
10138	'You would have us do nothing then." Sarai's lips were white with anger
10139	but her voice was firmly in control.
10140	'No. I would have us not to do the wrong thing." Sarai expelled her
10141	breath in a hiss. She waved toward the window where their four-year-old
10142	was visible playing with her toy horses in the backyard. 'Do you think
10143	she has time for us to do the wrong thing... or anything · . .
10144	indefinitely?"
10145	'Sit down, Mother."
10146	Sarai remained standing. There was the faintest sprinkling of spilled
10147	sugar on the front of her tan cotton dress. Sol remembered the young
10148	woman rising nude from the phosphorescent wake of the motile isle on
10149	Maul-Covenant.
10150	'We have to do something,' she said.
10151	'We've seen over a hundred medical and scientific experts. She's been
10152	tested, prodded, probed, and tortured by two dozen research centers.
10153	l've been to the Shrike Church on every world in this Web; they won't
10154	see me. Melio and the other Hyperion experts at Reichs say that the
10155	Shrike Cult has nothing like the Merlin sickness in their doctrine and
10156	the indigenies on Hyperion have no legends of the malady or clues to its
10157	cure.
10158	Research during the three years the team was on Hyperion showed nothing.
10159	Now research there is illegal.
10160	Access to the Time Tombs is granted only to the so-called pilgrims. Even
10161	getting a travel visa to Hyperion is becoming almost impossible. And if
10162	we take Rachel; the trip may kill her."
10163	Sol paused for breath, touched Sarai's arm again.
10164	'I'm sorry to repeat all this, Mother. But we have done something."
10165	'Not enough,' said Sarai. 'What if we go as pilgrims?" Sol folded his
10166	arms in frustration. 'The Church of the Shrike chooses its sacrificial
10167	victims from thousands of volunteers. The Web is full of stupid,
10168	depressed people.
10169	Few of these return."
10170	'Doesn't that prove something?" Sarai whispered quickly, urgently.
10171	'Somebody or something is preying on these people."
10172	'Bandits,' said Sol.
10173	Sarai shook her head· 'The golem."
10174	'You mean the Shrike."
10175	'It's the golem,' insisted Sarai. 'The same one we see in the dream."
10176	Sol was uneasy. 'l don't see a golem in the dream.
10177	What golem?"
10178	'The red eyes that watch,' said Sarai. 'It's the same
10179	golem that Rachel heard that night in the Sphinx." 'How do you know that
10180	she heard anything?"
10181	'It's in the dream,' said Sarai. 'Before we enter the place where the
10182	golem waits."
10183	'We haven't dreamed the same dream,' said Sol.
10184	'Mother, Mother ... why haven't you told me this before?"
10185	'I thought I was going mad,' whispered Sarai.
10186	Sol thought of his secret conversations with God and put his arm around
10187	his wife.
10188	'Oh, Sol,' she whispered against him, 'it hurts so much to watch. And
10189	it's so lonely here."
10190	Sol held her. They had tried to go home- home would always be Barnard's
10191	World - half a dozen times to visit family and friends, but each time
10192	the visits were ruined by an invasion of newsteeps and tourists. It was
10193	no one's fault. News traveled almost instantaneously through the
10194	megadatasphere of a hundred and sixty Web worlds. To scratch the
10195	curiosity itch one had only to pass a universal card across a terminex
10196	diskey and step through a farcaster. They had tried arriving
10197	unannounced and traveling incognito but they were not spies and the
10198	efforts were pitiful. Within twenty-four standard hours of their
10199	reentry to the Web, they were besieged. Research institutes and large
10200	med centers easily provided the security screen for such a visit, but
10201	friends and family suffered. Rachel was NEWS.
10202	'Perhaps we could invite Tetha and Richard again · . ." began Sarai.
10203	'I have a better idea,' said Sol. 'Go yourself, Mother.
10204	You want to see your sister but you also want to see, hear, and smell
10205	home... watch a sunset where there are no iguanas... walk in the
10206	fields. Go."
10207	'Go? Just me? I couldn't be away from Rachel..." 'Nonsense,' said Sol.
10208	'Twice in twenty years - almost forty if we count the good days before .
10209	. . anyway, twice in twenty years doesn't constitute child neglect.
10210	It's a wonder that this family can stand one another, we've been cooped
10211	up together so long."
10212	Sarai looked at the tabletop, lost in thought. 'But wouldn't the news
10213	people find me?"
10214	'I bet not,' said Sol. 'It's Rachel they seem to key on.
10215	If they do hound you, come home. But I bet you can have a week visiting
10216	everyone at home before the teeps catch on."
10217	'A week,' gasped Sarai. 'I couldn't..."
10218	'Of course you can. In fact, you must. It will give me a few days to
10219	spend more time with Rachel and then when you come back refreshed I'll
10220	spend some days selfishly working on the book."
10221	'The Kierkegaard one?"
10222	'No. Something l've been playing with called The Abraham Problem."
10223	'Clumsy title,' said Sarai.
10224	'It's a clumsy problem,' said Sol. 'Now go get packed.
10225	We'll fly you to New Jerusalem tomorrow so you can 'cast out before the
10226	Sabbath begins."
10227	'I'II think about it,' she said, sounding unconvinced.
10228	'You'll pack,' said Sol, hugging her again. When the hug was completed
10229	he had turned her away from the window so that she faced the hallway and
10230	the bedroom door. 'Go. When you return from home VII have thought of
10231	something we can do."
10232	Sarai paused. 'Do you promise?"
10233	Sol looked at her. 'I promise I will before time destroys everything. I
10234	swear as Rachel's father that VIi find a way."
10235	Sarai nodded, more relaxed than he had seen her in months. 'l'll go
10236	pack,' she said.
10237	When he and the child returned from New Jerusalem the next day, Sol went
10238	out to water the meager lawn while Rachel played quietly inside. When
10239	he came in, the pink glow of sunset infusing the walls with a sense of
10240	sea warmth and quiet, Rachel was not in her bedroom or the other usual
10241	places. 'Rachel?"
10242	When there was no answer he checked the backyard again, the empty
10243	street.
10244	'Rachel!" Sol ran in to call the neighbors but suddenly there was the
10245	slightest of sounds from the deep closet Sarai used for storage. Sol
10246	quietly opened the screen panel.
10247	Rachel sat beneath the hanging clothes, Sarai's antique pine box open
10248	between her legs. The floor was littered with photos and holochips of
10249	Rachel as a high school student, Rachel on the day she set off for
10250	college, Rachel standing in front of a carved mountainside on Hyperion.
10251	Rachel's research comlog lay whispering on the four-year-old Rachel's
10252	lap. Sol's heart seized at the familiar sound of the confident young
10253	woman's voice.
10254	'Daddy,' said the child on the floor, her own voice a tiny frightened
10255	echo of the voice on the comlog, 'you
10256	never told me that I had a sister."
10257	'You don't, little one."
10258	Rachel frowned. 'Is this Mommy when she was . . .
10259	not so big? Uh-uh, it can't be. Her name's Rachel, too, she says. How
10260	can..."
10261	'It's all right,' he said. 'VII explain . . ." Sol realized that the
10262	phone was ringing in the living room, had been ringing. 'Just a moment,
10263	sweetie. I'll be right back."
10264	The holo that formed above the pit was of a man Sol had never seen
10265	before. Sol did not activate his own imager, eager to get rid of the
10266	caller. 'Yes?" he said abruptly.
10267	'M. Weintraub? M. Weintraub who used to live on Barnard's World,
10268	currently in the village of Dan on Hebron?"
10269	Sol started to disconnect and then paused. Their access code was
10270	untiled. Occasionally a salesperson called from New Jerusalem, but
10271	offworld calls were rare. And, Sol suddenly realized, his stomach
10272	feeling a stab of cold, it was past sundown on the Sabbath. Only
10273	emergency holo calls were allowed.
10274	'Yes?" said Sol.
10275	'M. Weintraub,' said the man, staring blindly past Sol, 'there's been a
10276	terrible accident."
10277	When Rachel awoke her father was sitting by the side of her bed. He
10278	looked tired. His eyes were red and his cheeks were gray with stubble
10279	above the line of his beard.
10280	'Good morning, Daddy."
10281	'Good morning, sweetheart."
10282	Rachel looked around and blinked. Some of her dolls and toys and things
10283	were there, but the room was not hers. The light was different. The
10284	air felt different. Her
10285	daddy looked different. 'Where are we, Daddy?" 'We've gone on a trip,
10286	little one." 'Where to?"
10287	'It doesn't matter right now. Hop out, sweetie. Your bath is ready and
10288	then we have to get dressed."
10289	A dark dress she had never seen before lay at the base of her bed.
10290	Rachel looked at the dress and then back at her father. 'Daddy, what's
10291	the matter? Where's Mommy?" ·
10292	Sol rubbed his cheek. It was the third morning since the accident. It
10293	was the day of the funeral. He had told her each of the preceding days
10294	because he could not imagine lying to her then; it seemed the ultimate
10295	betrayal- of both Sarai and Rachel. But hc did not think he could do it
10296	again. 'There's been an accident, Rachel,' he said, his voice a pained
10297	rasp. 'Mommy died.
10298	We're going to go say goodbye to her today." Sol paused. He knew by now
10299	that it would take a minute for the fact of her mother's death to become
10300	real for Rachel.
10301	On the first day he had not known if a four-year-old could truly
10302	comprehend the concept of death. He knew now that Rachel could.
10303	Later, as he held the sobbing child, Sol tried to understand the
10304	accident he had described so briefly to her.
10305	EMVs were by far the safest form of personal transportation mankind had
10306	ever designed. Their lifters could fail but, even so, the residual
10307	charge in the EM generators would allow the aircar to descend safely
10308	from any altitude. The basic, failsafe design of an EMV's
10309	collision-avoidance equipment had not changed in centuries. But
10310	everything failed. In this case it was a joy-riding teenage couple in a
10311	stolen EMV outside the traffic lanes, accelerating to Mach I.5 with all
10312	lights and transponders off to avoid detection, who defied all odds by
10313	colliding with Aunt Tetha's ancient Vikken as it descended toward the
10314	Bussard City Opera House landing apron. Besides Tetha and Sarai and the
10315	teenagers, three others died in the crash as pieces of falling vehicles
10316	cartwheeled into the crowded atrium of the Opera House
10317	itself.
10318	Sarai.
10319	'Will we ever see Mommy again?" Rachel asked between sobs. She had
10320	asked this each time.
10321	'I don't know, sweetheart,' responded Sol truthfully.
10322	The funeral was at the family cemetery in gates County on Barnard's
10323	World. The press did not invade the graveyard itself but teeps hovered
10324	beyond the trees and pressed against the black iron gate like an angry
10325	storm tide.
10326	Richard wanted Sol and Rachel to stay a few days, but Sol knew what pain
10327	would be inflicted on the quiet farmer if the press continued their
10328	assault. Instead, he hugged Richard, spoke briefly to the clamoring
10329	reporters beyond the fence, and fled to Hebron with a stunned and silent
10330	Rachel in tow.
10331	Newsteeps followed to New Jerusalem and then attempted to follow to Dan,
10332	but military police overrode their chartered EMVs, threw a dozen in jail
10333	as an example, and revoked the farcaster visas of the rest.
10334	In the evening Sol walked the ridge lines above the village while Judy
10335	watched his sleeping child. He found that his dialogue with God was
10336	audible now and he resisted the urge to shake his fist at the sky, to
10337	shout obscenities, to throw stones. Instead he asked questions, always
10338	ending with - Why?
10339	There was no answer. Hebron's sun set behind distant ridges and the
10340	rocks glowed as they gave up their heat. Sol sat on a boulder and
10341	rubbed his temples with his palms.
10342	Sarai.
10343	They had lived a full life, even with the tragedy of Rachel's illness
10344	hanging over them. It was too ironic that in Sarai's first hour of
10345	relaxation with her sister... Sol moaned aloud.
10346	The trap, of course, had been in their total absorption with Rachel's
10347	illness. Neither had been able to face the future beyond Racbel's...
10348	death? Disappearance? The world had hinged upon each day their child
10349	lived and no thought had been given to the chance of accident, the
10350	perverse antilogic of a sharp-edged universe. Sol was sure that Sarai
10351	had considered suicide just as he had, but neither of them could ever
10352	have abandoned the other. Or Rachel. He had never considered the
10353	possibility of being
10354	alone with Rachel when...
10355	Sarai!
10356	At that moment Sol realized that the often angry dialogue which his
10357	people had been having with God for so many millennia had not ended with
10358	the death of Old Earth... nor with the new Diaspora... but continued
10359	still. He and Rachel and Sarai had been part of it, were part of it
10360	now. He let the pain come. It filled him with the sharp-edged agony of
10361	resolve.
10362	Sol stood on the ridge line and wept as darkness fell.
10363	In the morning he was next to Rachel's bed when sunlight filled the
10364	room.
10365	'Good morning, Daddy." 'Good morning, sweetheart." 'Where are we,
10366	Daddy?"
10367	'We've gone on a trip. It's a pretty place."
10368	'Where's Mommy?"
10369	'She's with Aunt Tetha today."
10370	'Will we see her tomorrow?"
10371	'Yes,' said Sol. 'Now let's get you dressed and I'll make breakfast."
10372	Sol began to petition the Church of the Shrike when Rachel turned three.
10373	Travel to Hyperion was severely limited and access to the Time Tombs had
10374	become all but impossible. Only the occasional Shrike Pilgrimage sent
10375	people to that region.
10376	Rachel was sad that she had to be away from her
10377	mother on her birthday but the visit of several children from the
10378	kibbutz distracted her a bit. Her big present was an illustrated book
10379	of fairy tales which Sarai had picked out in New Jerusalem months
10380	before.
10381	S0I read some of the stories to Rachel before bedtime.
10382	It had been seven months since she could read any of the words herself.
10383	But she loved the stories- especially 'Sleeping Beauty' - and made her
10384	father read it to her twice.
10385	'I'm gonna show Mommy it when we get home,' she said through a yawn as
10386	Sol turned out the overhead light.
10387	'Good night, kiddo,' he said softly, pausing at the door.
10388	'Hey, Daddy?"
10389	'Yes?"
10390	' 'Later, alligator."
10391	' 'While, crocodile."
10392	Rachel giggled into her pillow.
10393	It was, Sol thought during the final two years, not so much different
10394	from watching a loved one falling into old age. Only worse. A thousand
10395	times worse.
10396	Rachel's permanent teeth had fallen out over intervals between her
10397	eighth and second birthdays. Baby teeth replaced them but by her
10398	eighteenth month half of these had receded into her jaw.
10399	Rachei's hair, always her one vanity, grew shorter and thinner. Her
10400	face lost its familiar structure as baby fat obscured the cheekbones and
10401	firm chin. Her coordination failed by degrees, noticeable at first in a
10402	sudden clumsiness as she handled a fork or pencil. On the day she could
10403	no longer walk, Sol put her down in her crib early and then went into
10404	his study to get thoroughly and quietly drunk.
10405	Language was the hardest for him. Her vocabulary loss was like the
10406	burning of a bridge between them, the severing of a final line of hope.
10407	It was sometime after her second birthday receded that Sol tucked her in
10408	and, pausing in the doorway, said, ''Later, alligator."
10409	'Huh?"
10410	'See you later, alligator.
10411	Rachel si,led.
10412	'You say- "In a while, crocodile," ' said Sol. He
10413	told her what an alligator and crocodile were.
10414	'In a while, 'acadile,' giggled Rachel.
10415	In the morning she had forgotten.
10416	Sol took Rachel with him as he traveled the Web - no longer caring about
10417	the newsteeps- petitioning the Shrike Church for pilgrimage rights,
10418	lobbying the Senate for a visa and access to forbidden areas on
10419	Hyperion, and visiting any research institute or clinic which might
10420	offer a cure. Months were lost while more medics admitted failure. When
10421	he fled back to Hebron, Rachel was fifteen standard months old; in the
10422	ancient units used on Hebron she weighed twenty-five pounds and measured
10423	thirty inches tall. She could no longer dress herself. Her vocabulary
10424	consisted of twenty-five words, of which her favorites were 'Mommy' and
10425	'Daddy."
10426	SOl loved carrying his daughter. There were times when the curve of her
10427	head against his cheek, her warmth against his chest, the smell of her
10428	skin - all worked to allow him to forget the fierce injustice of it all.
10429	At those times Sol would have been temporarily at peace with the
10430	universe if only Sarai had been there. As it was, there were temporary
10431	cease-fires in his angry dialogue with a God in Whom he did not believe.
10432	What possible reason can there be for this?
10433	What reason has been visible for all of the forms of pain suffered by
10434	humankind?
10435	Precisely, thought Sol, wondering if he had just won a point for the
10436	first time. He doubted it.
10437	The fact of a thing not being visible does not mean it does not exist.
10438	That's clumsy. It shouldn't take three negatives to make a statement.
10439	Especially to state something as nonprofound as that.
10440	- Precisely, Sol. You're beginning to get the drift of all
10441	this.
10442	- What?
10443	There was no answer to his thoughts. Sol lay in his house and listened
10444	to the desert wind blow.
10445	Rachel's last word was 'Mamma,' uttered when she was just over five
10446	months old.
10447	She awoke in her crib and did not - could not - ask where she was. Her
10448	world was one of mealtimes, naps, and toys. Sometimes when she cried
10449	Sol wondered if she was crying for her mother.
10450	Sol shopped in the small stores in Dan, taking the infant with him as he
10451	selected diapers, nursing paks, and the occasional new toy.
10452	The week before Sol left for Tau Ceti Center, Ephraim and the two other
10453	elders came to talk. It was evening and the fading light glowed on
10454	Ephraim's bald scalp. 'Sol, we're worried about you. The next few
10455	weeks will be hard. The women want to help. We want to help."
10456	Sol laid his hand on the older man's forearm. 'It's appreciated,
10457	Ephraim. Everything the last few years is appreciated. This is our
10458	home now, too. $arai would have... would have wanted me to say thank
10459	you. But we're leaving on Sunday. Rachel is going to get better."
10460	The three men on the long bench looked at one another.
10461	Avner said, 'They've found a cure?"
10462	'No,' said Sol, 'but I've found a reason to hope." 'Hope is good,'
10463	Robert said in cautious tones.
10464	Sol grinned, his teeth white against the gray of his beard. 'It had
10465	better be,' he said. 'Sometimes it is all we're given."
10466	The studio holo camera zoomed in for a close-up of Rachel as the infant
10467	sat cradled in Sol's arm on the set of 'Common Talk." 'So you're
10468	saying,' said Devon Whiteshire, the show's host and the third-best-known
10469	face in the Web datasphere, 'that the Shrike Church's refusal to allow
10470	you to return to the Time Tombs...
10471	and the Hegemony's tardiness in processing a visa...
10472	these things will doom your child to this... extinction?"
10473	'Precisely,' said Sol. 'The voyage to Hyperion cannot be made in under
10474	six weeks. Rachel is now twelve weeks old.
10475	Any further delay by either the Shrike Church or the Web bureaucracy
10476	will kill this child."
10477	The studio audience stirred. Devon Whiteshire turned toward the nearest
10478	imaging remote. His craggy, friendly visage filled the monitor frame.
10479	'This man doesn't know if he can save his child,' said Whiteshire, his
10480	voice powerful with subtle feeling, 'but all he asks is a chance. Do
10481	you think he... and the baby... deserve one? If so, access your
10482	planetary representatives and your nearest Church of the Shrike temple.
10483	The number of your nearest temple should be appearing now." He turned
10484	back to Sol. 'We wish you luck, M. Weintraub. And' - Whiteshire's
10485	large hand touched Rachel's cheek - 'we wish you Godspeed, our young
10486	friend."
10487	The monitor image held on Rachel until it faded to black.
10488	The Hawking effect caused nausea, vertigo, headache, and hallucinations.
10489	The first leg of the voyage was the ten-day transit to Parvati on the
10490	Hegemony torchship HS Intrepid.
10491	Sol held Rachel and endured. They were the only people fully conscious
10492	aboard the warship. At first Rachel cried, but after some hours she lay
10493	quietly in SOI's arms and stared up at him with large, dark eyes. Sol
10494	remembered the day she was born - the medics had taken tbe infant from
10495	atop Sarai's warm stomach and handed her to Sol.
10496	Rachel's dark hair was not much shorter then, her gaze no less profound.
10497	Eventually they slept from sheer exhaustion.
10498	Sol dreamed that he was wandering through a structure with columns the
10499	size of redwood trees and a ceiling lost to sight far above him. Red
10500	light bathed cool emptiness. Sol was surprised to find that he still
10501	carried Rachel in his arms.
10502	Rachel as a child had never been in his dream before. The infant looked
10503	up at him and Sol felt the contact of her consciousness as surely as if
10504	she had spoken aloud.
10505	Suddenly a different voice, immense and cold, echoed through the void:
10506	'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, Whom you love, and
10507	go to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering
10508	at one of the places of which I shall tell you."
10509	Sol hesitated and looked back to Rachel. The baby's eyes were deep and
10510	luminous as she looked up at her father. Sol felt the unspoken yes.
10511	Holding her tightly, he stepped forward into the darkness and raised his
10512	voice against the silence:
10513	'Listen! There will be no more offerings, neither child nor parent.
10514	There will be no more sacrifices for anyone other than our fellow human.
10515	The time of obedience and atonement is past."
10516	Sol listened. He could feel the pounding of his heart and Rachel's
10517	warmth against his arm. From somewhere high above there came the cold
10518	sound of wind through unseen fissures. Sol cupped his hand to his mouth
10519	and shouted:
10520	'That's all! Now either leave us alone or join us as a father rather
10521	than a receiver of sacrifices. You have the choice of Abraham!'
10522	Rachel stirred in his arms as a rumble grew out of the stone floor.
10523	Columns vibrated. The red gloom deepened and then winked out, leaving
10524	only darkness.
10525	From far away there came the boom of huge footsteps.
10526	Sol hugged Rachel to him as a violent wind roared past.
10527	There was a glimmer of light as both he and Rachel awoke on the HS
10528	Intrepid outward bound for Parvati to transfer to the treeship
10529	Yggdrasill for the planet Hyperion. Sol smiled at his seven-week-old
10530	daughter.
10531	She smiled back.
10532	It was her last and her first smile.
10533	The main cabin of the windwagon was silent when the old scholar finished
10534	his story. Sol cleared his throat and took a drink of water from a
10535	crystal goblet. Rachel slept on in the makeshift cradle of the open
10536	drawer. The windwagon rocked gently on its way, the rumble of the great
10537	wheel and the hum of the main gyroscope a lu!ling background noise.
10538	'My God,' Brawne Lamia said softly. She started to speak again and then
10539	merely shook her head.
10540	Martin Silenus closed his eyes and said:
10541	'Considering that, all hatred driven hence, The soul recovers radical
10542	innocence
10543	And learns at last that it is self-delighting, Self-appeasing,
10544	seif-affrighting,
10545	And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will; She can, though every face
10546	will scowl
10547	And every windy quarter howl
10548	Or every bellows burst, be happy still."
10549	Sol Weintraub asked, 'William Butler Yeats?" Silenus nodded. ' "A
10550	Prayer for My Daughter." '
10551	'I think l'm going up on deck for a breath of air before turning in,'
10552	said the Consul. 'Would anyone care to join me?"
10553	Everyone did. The breeze of their passage was refreshing as the group
10554	stood on the quarterdeck and watched the darkened Sea of Grass rumble
10555	by. The sky was a great, star-splashed bowl above them, scarred by
10556	meteor trails. The sails and rigging creaked with a sound as old as
10557	human travel.
10558	'I think we should post guards tonight,' said Colonel Kassad. 'One
10559	person on watch while the others sleep.
10560	Two-hours intervals."
10561	'I agree,' said the Consul. 'l'il take the first watch." 'In the
10562	morning..." began Kassad.
10563	'Look!" cried Father Hoyt.
10564	They followed his pointing arm. Between the blaze of constellations,
10565	colored fireballs flared- green, violet,
10566	orange, green again- illuminating the great plain of grass around them
10567	like flashes of heat lightning. The stars and meteor trails paled to
10568	insignificance beside the sudden display.
10569	'Explosions?" ventured the priest.
10570	'Space battle,' said Kassad. 'Cislunar. Fusion weapons." He went below
10571	quickly.
10572	'The Tree,' said l-let Masteen, pointing to a speck of light which moved
10573	among the explosions like an ember floating through a fireworks display.
10574	Kassad returned with his powered binoculars and handed them around.
10575	'Ousters?" asked Lamia. 'Is it the invasion?" 'Ousters, almost
10576	certainly,' said Kassad. 'But almost as certainly just a scouting raid.
10577	See the clusters? Those are Hegemony missiles being exploded by the
10578	Ouster ramscouts' countermeasures."
10579	The binoculars came to the Consul. The flashes were quite clear now, an
10580	expanding cumulus of flame. He could see the speck and long blue tail
10581	of at least two scoutships fleeing from the Hegemony pursuers.
10582	'I don't think..." began Kassad and then stopped as the ship and sails
10583	and Sea of Grass glowed bright orange in reflected glare.
10584	'Dear Christ,' whispered Father Hoyt. 'They've hit the treeship."
10585	The Consult swept the glass left. The growing nimbus of flames could be
10586	seen with the naked eye but in the binoculars the kilometer-long trunk
10587	and branch array of the Yggdrasiil was visible for an instant as it
10588	burned and flared, long tendrils of flame arcing away into space as the
10589	containment fields failed and the oxygen burned.
10590	The orange cloud pulsed, faded, and fell back on itself as the trunk
10591	became visible for a final second even as it glowed and broke up like
10592	the last long ember in a dying fire. Nothing could have survived. The
10593	treeship Yggdrasill with its crew and complement of clones and
10594	semisentient erg drivers was dead.
10595	The Consul turned toward Het Masteen and belatedly held out the
10596	binoculars. 'I'm so ... sorry,' he whispered.
10597	The tall Templar did not take the glasses. Slowly he lowered his gaze
10598	from the skies, pulled forward his cowl, and went below without a word.
10599	The death of the treeship was the final explosion.
10600	When ten minutes had passed and no more flares had disturbed the night,
10601	Brawne Lamia spoke. 'Do you think they got them?"
10602	'The Ousters?" said Kassad. 'Probably not. The scoutships are built
10603	for speed and defense. They're light-minutes away by now."
10604	'Did they go after the treeship on purpose?" asked Silenus. The poet
10605	sounded very sober.
10606	'I think not,' said Kassad. 'Merely a target of opportunity."
10607	'Target of opportunity,' echoed Sol Weintraub. The scholar shook his
10608	head. 'I'm going to get a few hours' sleep before sunrise."
10609	One by one the others went below. When only Kassad and the Consul were
10610	left on deck, the Consul said, 'Where should I stand watch?"
10611	'Make a circuit,' said the Colonel. 'From the main corridor at the base
10612	of the ladder you can see all of the stateroom doors and the entrance to
10613	the mess and galley.
10614	Come above and check the gangway and decks. Keep the
10615	lanterns lit. Do you have a weapon?"
10616	The Consul shook his head.
10617	Kassad handed over his deathwand. 'It's on tight beam - about half a
10618	meter at ten meters' range. Don't use it unless you're sure that
10619	there's an intruder.
10620	The rough plate that slides forward is the safety.
10621	It's on."
10622	The Consul nodded, making sure that his finger stayed away from the
10623	firing stud.
10624	'VII relieve you in two hours,' said Kassad. He checked his comlog.
10625	'It'll be sunrise before my watch is over." Kassad looked at the sky as
10626	if expecting the Yggdrasill to reappear and continue its firefly path
10627	across the sky. Only the stars glowed back. On the northeastern
10628	horizon a moving mass of black promised a storm.
10629	Kassad shook his head. 'A waste,' he said and went below.
10630	The Consul stood there awhile and listened to the wind in the canvas,
10631	the creek of rigging, and the rumble of the wheel. After a while he
10632	went to the railing and stared at darkness while he thought.
10633	FIVE
10634	Sunrise over the Sea of Grass was a thing of beauty. The Consul watched
10635	from the highest point on the aft deck.
10636	After his watch he had tried to sleep, given it up, and come up onto
10637	deck to watch the night fade into day. The stormfront had covered the
10638	sky with low clouds and the rising sun lit the world with brilliant gold
10639	reflected from above and below. The windwagon's sails and lines and
10640	weathered planks glowed in the brief benediction of light in the few
10641	minutes before the sun was blocked by the ceiling of clouds and color
10642	flowed out of the world once again. The wind which followed this
10643	curtain closing was chill, as if it had blown down from the snowy peaks
10644	of the Bridle Range just visible as a dark blur on the northeastern
10645	horizon.
10646	Brawne Lamia and Martin Silenus joined the Consul on the aft deck, each
10647	nursing a cup of coffee from the galley. The wind whipped and tugged at
10648	the rigging.
10649	Brawne Lamia's thick mass of curls fluttered around her face like a dark
10650	nimbus.
10651	'Morning,' muttered Silenus, squinting out over his coffee cup at the
10652	wind-rippled Sea of Grass.
10653	'Good morning,' replied the Consul, amazed at how alert and refreshed he
10654	felt for not having slept at all the night before. 'We have a headwind,
10655	but the wagon still seems to be making decent time. We'll definitely be
10656	to the mountains before nightfall."
10657	'Hrrgnn,' commented Silenus and buried his nose in the coffee cup.
10658	'I didn't sleep at all last night,' said Brawne Lamia, 'just for
10659	thinking about M. Weintraub's story. '
10660	'I don't think..." began the poet and then broke off
10661	as Weintraub came onto deck, his baby peering over the lip of an infant
10662	carrier sling on his chest.
10663	'Good morning, everyone,' said Weintraub, looking around and taking a
10664	deep breath. 'Mmm, brisk, isn't it?"
10665	'Fucking freezing,' said Silenus. 'North of the mountains it'll be even
10666	worse."
10667	'I think l'll go down to get a jacket,' said Lamia, but before she could
10668	move there came a single shrill cry from the deck below.
10669	'Blood!'
10670	There was, indeed, blood everywhere. Het Masteen's cabin was strangely
10671	neat - bed unslept in, travel trunk and other boxes stacked precisely in
10672	one corner, robe folded over a chair - except for the blood which
10673	covered great sections of the deck, bulkhead, and overhead. The six
10674	pilgrims crowded just inside the entrance, reluctant to go farther in.
10675	'I was passing on my way to the upper deck,' said Father Hoyt, his voice
10676	a strange monotone. 'The door was slightly ajar. I caught a glimpse
10677	of... the blood on the wall."
10678	'Is it blood?" demanded Martin Silenus.
10679	Brawn. Lamia stepped into the room, ran a hand through a thick smear on
10680	the bulkhead, and raised her fingers to her lips. 'It's blood." She
10681	looked around, walked to the wardrobe, looked briefly among the empty
10682	shelves and hangers, and then went to the small porthole.
10683	It was latched and bolted from the inside.
10684	Lenar Hoyt looked more ill than usual and staggered to a chair. 'Is he
10685	dead then?"
10686	'We don't know a damn thing except that Captain Masteen isn't in his
10687	room and a lot of blood/s,' said Lamia. She wiped her hand on her pant
10688	leg. 'The thing to do now is search the ship thoroughly."
10689	'Precisely,' said Colonel Kassad, 'and if we do not find the Captain?"
10690	Brawne Lamia opened the porthole. Fresh air dissipated the
10691	slaughterhouse smell of blood and brought in the rumble of the wheel and
10692	the rustle of grass under the hull. 'If we don't find Captain Masteen,'
10693	she
10694	said, 'then we assume that he either left the ship under his own will or
10695	was taken off."
10696	'But the blood..." began Father Hoyt.
10697	'Doesn't prove anything,' finished Kassad.
10698	'M. Lamia's correct. We don't know Masteen's blood type or genotype.
10699	Did anyone see or hear anything?"
10700	There was silence except for negative grunts and the shaking of heads.
10701	Martin Silenus looked around. 'Don't you people recognize the work of
10702	our friend the Shrike when you see it?"
10703	'We don't know that,' snapped Lamia. 'Maybe someone wanted us to think
10704	that it was the Shrike's doing."
10705	'That doesn't make sense,' said Hoyt, still gasping for air.
10706	'Nonetheless,' said Lamia, 'we'll search in twos. Who has weapons
10707	besides myself?."
10708	'I do,' said Colonel Kassad. 'I have extras if needed." 'No,' said
10709	Hoyt.
10710	The poet shook his head.
10711	Sol Weintraub had returned to the corridor with his child. Now he
10712	looked in again. 'I have nothing,' he said.
10713	'No,' said the Consul. He had returned the deathwand to Kassad when his
10714	shift ended two hours before first light.
10715	'All right,' said Lamia, 'the priest will come with me on the lower
10716	deck. Silenus, go with the Colonel. Search the mid-deck. M.
10717	Weintraub, you and the Consul check everything above. Look for anything
10718	out of the ordinary.
10719	Any sign of struggle."
10720	'One question,' said Silenus.
10721	'What?"
10722	'Who the hell elected you queen of the prom?"
10723	'I'm a private investigator,' said Lamia, leveling her gaze on the poet.
10724	Martin Silenus shrugged. 'Hoyt here is a priest of some forgotten
10725	religion. That doesn't mean we have to genuflect when he says Mass."
10726	'All right,' sighed Brawne Lamia. 'I'll give you a better reason." The
10727	woman moved so fast that the Consul
10728	almost missed the action in a blink. One second she was standing by the
10729	open port and in the next she was half* way across the stateroom,
10730	lifting Martin Silenus off the deck with one arm, her massive hand
10731	around the poet's thin neck. 'How about,' she said, 'that you do the
10732	logical
10733	thing because it's the logical thing to do?"
10734	'Gkkrgghh,' managed Martin Silenus.
10735	'Good,' said Lamia without emotion and dropped the poet to the deck.
10736	Silenus staggered a meter and almost sat on Father Hoyt.
10737	'Here,' said Kassad, returning with two small neural stunners. He
10738	handed one to Sol Weintraub. 'What do you have?" Kassad asked Lamia.
10739	The woman reached into a pocket of her loose tunic and produced an
10740	ancient pistol.
10741	Kassad looked at the relic for a moment and then nodded. 'Stay with
10742	your partner,' he said. 'Don't shoot at anything unless it's positively
10743	identified and unquestionably threatening."
10744	'That describes the bitch I plan to shoot,' said Silenus, still
10745	massaging his throat.
10746	Brawne Lamia took a half step toward the poet.
10747	Fedmahn Kassad said, 'Shut up. Let's get this over with." Silenus
10748	followed the Colonel out of the stateroom.
10749	Sol Weintraub approached the Consul, handed him the stunner. 'I don't
10750	want to hold this thing with Rachel.
10751	Shall we go up?"
10752	The Consul took the weapon and nodded.
10753	The windwagon held no further sign of Templar Voice of the Tree Het
10754	Masteen. After an hour of searching, the group met in the stateroom of
10755	the missing man. The blood there seemed darker and drier.
10756	'Is there a chance that we missed something?" said Father Hoyt. 'Secret
10757	passages? Hidden compartments?"
10758	'There's a chance,' said Kassad, 'but l swept the ship with heat and
10759	motion sensors. If there's anything else on board larger than a mouse,
10760	I can't find it."
10761	'If you had these sensors,' said Silenus, 'why the fuck did you have us
10762	crawling through bilge and byways for an hour?"
10763	'Because the right equipment or apparel can hide a man from a
10764	heat-'n'-beat search."
10765	'So, in answer to my question,' said Hoyt, pausing a second as a visible
10766	wave of pain passed through him, 'with the right equipment or apparel,
10767	Captain Masteen might be hiding in a secret compartment somewhere."
10768	'Possible but improbable,' said Brawne Lamia. 'My guess is that he's no
10769	longer aboard."
10770	'The Shrike,' said Martin Silenus in a disgusted tone.
10771	It was not a question.
10772	'Perhaps,' said Lamia. 'Colonel, you and the Consul were on watch
10773	through those four hours. Are you sure
10774	that you heard and saw nothing?"
10775	Both men nodded.
10776	'The ship was quiet,' said Kassad. 'I would have heard a struggle even
10777	before I went on watch."
10778	'And I didn't sleep after my watch,' said the Consul.
10779	'My room shared a bulkhead with Masteen's. I heard nothing."
10780	'Well,' said Silenus, 'we've heard from the two men who were creeping
10781	around in the dark with weapons when the poor shit was killed. They say
10782	they're innocent.
10783	Next case! '
10784	'If Masteen was killed,' said Kassad, 'it was with no deathwand. No
10785	silent modern weapon I know throws that much blood around. There were
10786	no gunshots heard -no bullet holes found- so I presume M. Lamia's
10787	automatic pistol is not suspect. If this is Captain Masteen's blood,
10788	then I would guess an edged weapon was used."
10789	'The Shrike/s an edged weapon,' said Martin Silenus.
10790	Lamia moved to the small stack of luggage. 'Debating isn't going to
10791	solve anything. Let's see if there's anything in Masteen's belongings."
10792	Father Hoyt raised a hesitant hand. 'That's... well, private, isn't
10793	it? I don't think we have the right."
10794	Brawne Lamia crossed her arms. 'Look, Father, if Masteen's dead, it
10795	doesn't matter to him. If he's still alive, looking through this stuff
10796	might give us some idea where he was taken. Either way, we have to try
10797	to find a clue."
10798	Hoyt looked dubious but nodded. In the end, there was little invasion
10799	of privacy. Masteen's first trunk held only a few changes of linen and
10800	a copy of Muir's Book of Life. The second bag held a hundred separately
10801	wrapped seedlings, flash-dried and nestled in moist soil.
10802	'Templars must plant at least a hundred offspring of the Eternal Tree on
10803	whatever. world they visit,' explained the Consul. 'The shoots rarely
10804	take, but it's a ritual."
10805	Browne Lamia moved toward the large metal box which had sat at the
10806	bottom of the pile.
10807	'Don't touch that!" snapped the Consul.
10808	'Why not?"
10809	'It's a MObius cube,' responded Colonel Kassad for the Consul. 'A
10810	carbon-carbon-shell set around a zero impedance containment field folded
10811	back on itself."
10812	'So?" said Lamia. 'MObius cubes seal artifacts and stuff in. They
10813	don't explode or anything."
10814	'No,' agreed the Consul, 'but what they contain may explode. May
10815	already have exploded, for that matter."
10816	'A cube that size could hold a kiloton nuclear explosion in check as
10817	long as it was boxed during the nanosecond of ignition,' added Fedmahn
10818	Kassad.
10819	Lamia scowled at the trunk. 'Then how do we know that something in
10820	there didn't kill Masteen?"
10821	Kassad pointed to a faintly glowing green strip along the trunk's only
10822	seam. 'It's sealed. Once unsealed, a MObius cube has to be reactivated
10823	at a place where containment fields can be generated. Whatever's in
10824	there didn't harm Captain Masteen."
10825	'So there's no way to tell?" mused Lamia.
10826	'I have a good guess,' said the Consul.
10827	The others looked at him. Rachel began to cry and Sol pulled a heating
10828	strip on a nursing pak.
10829	'Remember,' said the Consul, 'at Edge yesterday when M. Masteen made a
10830	big deal out of the cube? He
10831	talked about it as if it were a secret weapon?"
10832	'A weapon?" said Lamia.
10833	'Of course!" Kassad said suddenly. 'An erg!'
10834	'Erg?" Martin Silenus stared at the small crate. 'l thought ergs were
10835	those forcefield critters that Templars use on their treeships."
10836	'They are,' said the Consul. 'The things were found about three
10837	centuries ago living on asteroids around Aldebaran. Bodies about as big
10838	as a cat's spine, mostly a piezoelectric nervous system sheathed in
10839	silicon gristle, but they feed on... and manipulate... forcefields as
10840	large as those generated by small spinships."
10841	'So how do you get all that into such a little box?" asked Silenus,
10842	staring at the MObius cube. 'Mirrors?"
10843	'In a sense,' said Kassad. 'The thing's field would be damped ...
10844	neither starving nor feeding. Rather like cryogenic fugue for us. Plus
10845	this must be a small one. A cub, so to speak."
10846	Lamia ran her hand along the metal sheath. 'Templars control these
10847	things? Communicate with them?"
10848	'Yes,' said Kassad. 'No one is quite sure how. It's one of the
10849	Brotherhood secrets. But Het Masteen must have been confident that the
10850	erg would help him with..."
10851	'The Shrike,' finished Martin Silenus. 'The Templar thought that this
10852	energy imp would be his secret weapon when he faced the Lord of Pain."
10853	The poet laughed.
10854	Father Hoyt cleared his throat. 'The Church has accepted the Hegemony's
10855	ruling that... these creatures ·.. ergs... are not sentient beings...
10856	and thus not candidates for salvation."
10857	'Oh, they're sentient, all right, Father,' said the Consul.
10858	'They perceive things far better than we could ever imagine. But if you
10859	meant intelligent... self-aware...
10860	then you're dealing with something along the lines of a smart
10861	grasshopper. Are grasshoppers candidates for salvation?"
10862	Hoyt said nothing. Brawne Lamia said, 'Well, evidently Captain Masteen
10863	thought this thing was going to be his salvation. Something went
10864	wrong." She looked around at the bloodstained bulkheads and at the
10865	drying stains on the deck. 'Let's get out of here."
10866	The windwagon tacked into increasingly strong winds as the storm
10867	approached from the northeast. Ragged banners of clouds raced white
10868	beneath the low, gray ceiling of stormfront. Grasses whipped and bent
10869	under gusts of cold wind. Ripples of lightning illuminated the horizon
10870	and were followed by rolls of thunder sounding like warning shots across
10871	the windwagon's bow. The pilgrims watched in silence until the first
10872	icy raindrops drove them below to the large stateroom in the stern.
10873	'This was in his robe pocket,' said Brawne Lamia, holding up a slip of
10874	paper with the number $ on it.
10875	'So Masteen would have told his story next,' muttered the Consul.
10876	Martin Silenus tilted his chair until his back touched the tall windows.
10877	Storm light made his satyr's features appear slightly demonic. 'There's
10878	another possibility,' he said. 'Perhaps someone who hasn't spoken yet
10879	had the fifth spot and killed the Templar to trade places."
10880	Lamia stared at the poet. 'That would have to be the
10881	Consul or me,' she said, her voice flat.
10882	Silenus shrugged.
10883	Brawne Lamia pulled another piece of paper from her tunic. 'I have
10884	number six. What would I have achieved? I go next anyway."
10885	'Then perhaps it's what Masteen would have said that needed to be
10886	silenced,' said the poet. He shrugged again.
10887	'Personally, I think the Shrike has begun harvesting us.
10888	Why did we think we'd be allowed to get to the Tombs when the thing's
10889	been slaughtering people halfway from here to Keats?"
10890	'This is different,' said Sol Weintraub. 'This is the
10891	Shrike Pilgrimage."
10892	,So?,
10893	In the silence that followed, the Consul walked to the windows.
10894	Wind-driven torrents of rain obscured the Sea and rattled the leaded
10895	panes. The wagon creaked and leaned heavily to starboard as it began
10896	another leg of its tack.
10897	'M. Lamia,' asked Colonel Kassad, 'do you want to tell your story now?"
10898	Lamia folded her arms and looked at the rain-streaked glass. 'No. Let's
10899	wait until we get off this damned ship. It stinks of death."
10900	The windwagon reached the port of Pilgrims' Rest in midafternoon but the
10901	storm and tired light made it feel
10902	like late evening to the weary passengers. The Consul had expected
10903	representatives from the Shrike Temple to meet them here at the
10904	beginning of the penultimate stage of their journey but Pilgrims' Rest
10905	appeared to the Consul to be as empty as Edge had been.
10906	The approach to the foothills and the first sight of the Bridle Range
10907	was as exciting as any !andfall and brought all six of the would-be
10908	pilgrims on deck despite the cold rain which continued to fall. The
10909	foothills were sere and sensuous, their brown curves and sudden
10910	upthrustings contrasting strongly with the verdant monochrome of the Sea
10911	of Grass. The nine-thousand-meter peaks beyond were only hinted at by
10912	gray and white planes soon intersected by low clouds, but even so
10913	truncated were powerful to behold. The snow line came down to a point
10914	just above the collection of burned-out hovels and cheap hotels which
10915	had been Pilgrims' Rest.
10916	'If they destroyed the tramway, we're finished,' muttered the Consul.
10917	The thought of it, forbidden until now, made his stomach turn over.
10918	'I see the first five towers,' said Colonel Kassad, using
10919	his powered glasses. 'They seem intact."
10920	'Any sign of a car?"
10921	'No... wait, yes. There's one in the gate at the station platform."
10922	'Any moving?" asked Martin Silenus, who obviously understood how
10923	desperate their situation would be if the
10924	tramway was not intact.
10925	'No."
10926	The Consul shook his head. Even in the worst weather with no
10927	passengers, the cars had been kept moving to keep the great cables
10928	flexed and free of ice.
10929	The six of them had their luggage on deck even before the windwagon
10930	reefed its sails and extended a gangplank.
10931	Each now wore a heavy coat against the elements - Kassad in FORCE-issue
10932	thermouflage cape, Brawne Lamia in a long garment called a trenchcoat
10933	for reasons long forgotten, Martin Silenus in thick furs which rippled
10934	now sable, now gray with the vagaries of wind, Father Hoyt in long black
10935	which made him more of a scarecrow figure than ever, Sol Weintraub in a
10936	thick
10937	goosedown jacket which covered him and the child, and the Consul in the
10938	thinning but serviceable greatcoat his wife had given him some decades
10939	before.
10940	'What about Captain Masteen's things?" asked Sol as they stood at the
10941	head of the gangplank. Kassad had gone ahead to reconnoiter the
10942	village.
10943	'I brought them up,' said Lamia. 'We'll take them with us."
10944	'It doesn't seem right somehow,' said Father Hoyt.
10945	'Just going on, I mean. There should be some... service.
10946	Some recognition that a man has died."
10947	'May have died,' reminded Lamia, easily lifting a forty-kilo backpack
10948	with one hand.
10949	Hoyt looked incredulous. 'Do you really believe that M. Masteen might
10950	be alive?"
10951	'No,' said Lamia. Snowflakes settled on her black hair.
10952	Kassad waved to them from the end of the dock and they carried their
10953	luggage off the silent windwagon. No one looked back.
10954	'Empty?" called Lamia as they approached the Colonel.
10955	The tall man's cloak was still fading from its gray
10956	and black chameleon mode.
10957	'Empty." 'Bodies?"
10958	'No,' said Kassad. He turned toward Sol and the Con sul. 'Did you get
10959	the things from the galley?"
10960	Both men nodded.
10961	'What things?" asked Silenus.
10962	'A week's worth of food,' said Kassad, turning to look up the hill
10963	toward the tramway station. For the first time the Consul noticed the
10964	long assault weapon in the crook of the Colonel's arm, barely visible
10965	under the cloak.
10966	'We're not sure if there are any provisions beyond this point."
10967	Will we be alive a week from now? thought the Consul.
10968	He said nothing.
10969	They ferried the gear to the station in two trips. Wind whistled
10970	through the open windows and shattered domes of the dark buildings. On
10971	the second trip, the Consul carried one end of Masteen's M6bius cube
10972	while Lunar Hoyt puffed and panted under the other end.
10973	'Why are we taking the erg thing with us?" gasped Hoyt as they reached
10974	the base of the metal stairway leading to the station. Rust streaked
10975	and spotted the platform like orange lichen.
10976	'I don't know,' said the Consul, gasping for breath himself.
10977	From the terminal platform they could see far out over the Sea of Grass.
10978	The windwagon sat where they had left it, sails reefed, a dark and
10979	lifeless thing. Snow squalls moved across the prairie and gave the
10980	illusion of whitecaps on the numberless stalks of high grass.
10981	'Get the material aboard,' called Kassad. 'I'II see if the running gear
10982	can be reset from the operator's cabin up there."
10983	'Isn't it automatic?" asked Martin Silenus, his small head almost lost
10984	in thick furs. 'Like the windwagon?"
10985	'I don't think so,' said Kassad. 'Go on, I'll see if I can get it
10986	started up."
10987	'What if it leaves without you?" called Lamia at the Colonel's
10988	retreating back.
10989	'It won't."
10990	The interior of the tramcar was cold and bare except for metal benches
10991	in the forward compartment and a dozen rough bunks in the smaller, rear
10992	area. The car was big -at least eight meters long by five wide. The
10993	rear compartment was partitioned from the front cabin by a thin metal
10994	bulkhead with an opening but no door. A small commode took up a
10995	closet-sized corner of this aft compartment.
10996	Windows rising from waist height to the roof-line lined the forward
10997	compartment.
10998	The pilgrims heaped their luggage in the center of the wide floor and
10999	stomped around, waved their arms, or otherwise worked to stay warm.
11000	Martin Silenus lay full length on one of the benches, with only his feet
11001	and the top of his head emerging from fur. 'I forgot,' he said, 'how
11002	the fuck do you turn on the heat in this thing?"
11003	The Consul glanced at the dark lighting panels. 'It's electrical. It'll
11004	come on when the Colonel gets us moving."
11005	'If the Colonel gets us moving,' said Silenus.
11006	Sol Weintraub had changed Rachei's diaper. Now he bundled her up again
11007	in an infant's thermsuit and rocked her in his arms. 'Obviously l've
11008	never been here before,'
11009	he said. 'Both of you gentlemen have?"
11010	'Yeah,' said the poet.
11011	'No,' said the Consul. 'But I've seen pictures of the tramway."
11012	'Kassad said he returned to Keats once this way,' called Brawne Lamia
11013	from the other room.
11014	'I think ..." began Sol Weintraub and was interrupted by a great
11015	grinding of gears and a wild lurch as the long car rocked sickeningly
11016	and then swung forward under the suddenly moving cable. Everyone rushed
11017	to the window on the platform side.
11018	Kassad had thrown his gear aboard before climbing the long ladder to the
11019	operator's cabin. Now he appeared in the cabin's doorway, slid down the
11020	long ladder, and ran toward the car. The car was already passing beyond
11021	the loading area of the platform.
11022	'He isn't going to make it,' whispered Father Hoyt.
11023	Kassad sprinted the last ten meters with legs that looked impossibly
11024	long, a cartoon stick figure of a mall
11025	The tramcar slid out of the loading notch, swung free of the station.
11026	Space opened between the car and the station. It was eight meters to
11027	the rocks below. The platform deck was streaked with ice. Kassad ran
11028	full speed ahead even as the car pulled away.
11029	'Come on!" screamed Brawne Lamia. The others picked up the cry.
11030	The Consul looked up at sheaths of ice cracking and dropping away from
11031	the cable as the tramcar moved up and forward. He looked back. There
11032	was too much space. Kassad could never make it.
11033	Fedmahn Kassad was moving at an incredible speed when he reached the
11034	edge of the platform. The Consul was reminded for the second time of
11035	the Old Earth jaguar he had seen in a Lusus zoo. He half expected to
11036	see the Colonel's feet slip on a patch of ice, the long legs flying out
11037	horizontal, the man failing silently to the snowy boulders below.
11038	Instead, Kassad seemed to fly for
11039	an endless moment, long arms extended, cape flying out behind. He
11040	disappeared behind the car.
11041	There came a thud, followed by a long minute when no one spoke or moved.
11042	They were forty meters high now, climbing toward the first tower. A
11043	second later Kassad became visible at the corner of the car, pulling
11044	himself along a series of icy niches and handholds in the metal.
11045	Brawne Lamia flung open the cabin door. Ten hands helped pull Kassad
11046	inside.
11047	'Thank God,' said Father Hoyt.
11048	The Colonel took a deep breath and smiled grimly.
11049	'There was a dead man's brake. I had to rig the lever with a sandbag. I
11050	didn't want to bring the car back for a second try."
11051	Martin Silenus pointed to the rapidly approaching support tower and the
11052	ceiling of clouds just beyond. The cable stretched upward into
11053	oblivion. 'I guess we're
11054	crossing the mountains now whether we want to or not." 'How long to make
11055	the crossing?" asked Hoyt.
11056	'Twelve hours. A little less perhaps. Sometimes the operators would
11057	stop the cars if the wind rose too high or the ice got too bad."
11058	'We won't be stopping on this trip,' said Kassad.
11059	'Unless the cable's breached somewhere,' said the poet. 'Or we hit a
11060	snag."
11061	'Shut up,' said Lamia. 'Who's interested in heating some dinner?"
11062	'Look,' said the Consul.
11063	They moved to the forward windows. The tram rose a hundred meters above
11064	the last brown curve of foothills.
11065	Kilometers below and behind they caught a final glimpse of the station,
11066	the haunted hovels of Pilgrims' Rest, and the motionless windwagon.
11067	Then snow and thick cloud enveloped them.
11068	The tramcar had no real cooking facilities but the aft bulkhead offered
11069	a cold box and a microwave for reheating. Lamia and Weintraub combined
11070	various meats and vegetables from the windwagon's galley to produce a
11071	passable stew. Martin Silenus had brought along wine bottles from the
11072	Benares and the windwagon
11073	and he chose a Hyperion burgundy to go with the stew.
11074	They were nearly finished with their dinner when the gloom pressing
11075	against the windows lightened and then lifted altogether. The Consul
11076	turned on his bench to see the sun suddenly reappear, filling the
11077	tramcar with a transcendent golden light.
11078	There was a collective sigh from the group. It had seemed that darkness
11079	had fallen hours before, but now, as they rose above a sea of clouds
11080	from which rose an island chain of mountains, they were treated to a
11081	brilliant sunset. Hyperion's sky had deepened from its daytime glaucous
11082	glare to the bottomless lapis !azuli of evening while a red-gold sun
11083	ignited cloud towers and great summits of ice and rock. The Consul
11084	looked around. His fellow pilgrims, who had seemed gray and small in
11085	the dim light of half a minute earlier, now glowed in the gold of
11086	sunset.
11087	Martin Silenus raised his glass. 'That's better, by God."
11088	The Consul looked up at their line of travel, the massive cable
11089	dwindling to threadlike thinness far ahead and then to nothing at all.
11090	On a summit several kilometers beyond, gold light glinted on the next
11091	support tower.
11092	'One hundred and ninety-two pylons,' said Silenus in a singsong tour
11093	guide's bored tones. 'Each pylon is constructed of duralloy and
11094	whiskered carbon and stands eighty-three meters high."
11095	'We must be high,' said Brawne Lamia in a low voice.
11096	'The high point of the ninety-six-kilometer tramcar voyage lies above
11097	the summit of Mount Dryden, the fifth highest peak in the Bridle Range,
11098	at nine thousand two hundred forty-six meters,' droned on Martin
11099	Silenus.
11100	Colonel Kassad looked around. 'The cabin's pressur ized. I felt the
11101	change-over some time ago."
11102	'Look,' said Brawne Lamia.
11103	The sun had been resting on the horizon line of clouds for a long
11104	moment. Now it dipped below, seemingly igniting the depths of storm
11105	cloud from beneath and casting a panoply of colors along the entire
11106	western edge of the world. Snow cornices and glaze ice still glowed
11107	along the western side of the peaks, which rose a
11108	kilometer or more above the rising tramcar. A few brighter stars
11109	appeared in the deepening dome of sky.
11110	The Consul turned to Brawne Lamia. 'Why don't you tell your story now,
11111	M. Lamia? We'll want to sleep later, before arriving at the Keep."
11112	Lamia sipped the last of her wine. 'Does everyone want to hear it now?"
11113	Heads nodded in the roseate twilight. Martin Silenus shrugged.
11114	'All right,' said Brawne Lamia. She set down her empty glass, pulled
11115	her feet up on the bench so that her elbows rested on her knees, and
11116	began her tale.
11117	THE DETECTIVE'S TALE: The Long Good-Bye
11118	I knew the case was going to be special the minute that he walked into
11119	my office. He was beautiful. By that I don't mean effeminate or
11120	'pretty' in the male-model, HTV-star mode, merely... beautiful.
11121	He was a short man, no taller than I, and I was born and raised in
11122	Lusus's I.3-g field. It was apparent in a second that my visitor was
11123	not from Lusus - his compact form was well proportioned by Web
11124	standards, athletic but thin. His face was a study in purposeful
11125	energy: low brow, sharp cheekbones, compact nose, solid jaw, and a wide
11126	mouth that suggested both a sensuous side and a stubborn streak. His
11127	eyes were large and hazel-colored.
11128	He looked to be in his late twenties standard.
11129	Understand, I didn't itemize all this the moment he walked in. My first
11130	thought was, Is this a client? My
11131	second thought was, Shit, this guy'$ beautiful.
11132	'M. Lamia?" 'Yeah."
11133	'M. Brawne Lamia of AllWeb Investigations?" 'Yeah."
11134	He looked around as if he didn't quite believe it. I understood the
11135	look. My office is on the twenty-third level of an old industrial hive
11136	in the Old Digs section of Iron Pig on Lusus. I have three big windows
11137	that look
11138	out on Service Trench 9 where it's always dark and always drizzling
11139	thanks to a massive filter drip from the Hive above. The view is mostly
11140	of abandoned automated loading docks and rusted girders.
11141	What the hell, it's cheap. And most of my clients call rather than show
11142	up in person.
11143	'May I sit down?" he asked, evidently satisfied that a bona fide
11144	investigatory agency would operate out of such a slum.
11145	'Sure,' I said and waved him to a chair. 'M... ah?" 'Johnny,' he said.
11146	He didn't look like a first-name type to me. Something about him
11147	breathed money. It wasn't his clothes - common enough casuals in black
11148	and gray, although the fabric was better than average - it was just a
11149	sense that the guy had class. There was something about his accent.
11150	l'm good at placing dialects- it helps in this profession - but I
11151	couldn't place this guy's homeworld, much less local region.
11152	'How can I help you, Johnny?" I held out the bottle of Scotch I had been
11153	ready to put away as he entered.
11154	Johnny-boy shook his head. Maybe he thought I wanted him to drink from
11155	the bottle. Hell, I have more class than that. There are paper cups
11156	over by the water cooler. 'M. Lamia,' he said, the cultivated accent
11157	still
11158	bugging me by its elusiveness, 'I need an investigator." 'That's what I
11159	do."
11160	He paused. Shy. A lot of my clients are hesitant to tell me what the
11161	job is. No wonder, since ninety-five percent of my work is divorce and
11162	domestic stuff. I waited him out.
11163	'It's a somewhat sensitive matter,' he said at last.
11164	'Yeah, M . . . ah, Johnny, most of my work falls under that category.
11165	I'm bonded with UniWeb and everything having to do with a client falls
11166	under the Privacy Protection Act. Everything is confidential, even the
11167	fact that we're talking now. Even if you decide not to hire me." That
11168	was basic bullshit since the authorities could get at my files in a
11169	moment if they ever wanted to, but I sensed that I had to put this guy
11170	at ease somehow.
11171	God, he was beautiful.
11172	'Uh-huh,' he said and glanced around again. He leaned forward. 'M.
11173	Lamia, I would want you to investigate a murder."
11174	This got my attention. I'd been reclining with my feet on the desk; now
11175	I sat up and leaned forward. 'A mur der? Are you sure? What about the
11176	cops?"
11177	'They aren't involved."
11178	'That's not possible,' I said with the sinking feeling that I was
11179	dealing with a loony rather than a client. 'It's a crime to conceal a
11180	murder from the authorities." What I thought was: Are you the murderer,
11181	Johnny?
11182	He smiled and shook his head. 'Not in this case." 'What do you mean?"
11183	'I mean, M. Lamia, that a murder was committed but that the police-
11184	local and Hegemony- have neither knowledge of it nor jurisdiction over
11185	it."
11186	'Not possible,' I said again. Outside, sparks from an industrial
11187	welder's torch cascaded into the trench along with the rusty drizzle.
11188	'Explain."
11189	'A murder was committed outside of the Web. Outside of the
11190	Protectorate. There were no local authorities."
11191	That made sense. Sort of. For the life of me, though, I couldn't
11192	figure where he was talking about. Even the Outback settlements and
11193	colonial worlds have cops. On board some sort of spaceship? Uh-uh. The
11194	Interstellar Transit Authority has jurisdiction there.
11195	'I see,' I said. It'd been some weeks since l'd had a case. 'All
11196	right, tell me the details."
11197	'And the conversation will be confidential even if you
11198	do not take the case?"
11199	'Absolutely."
11200	'And if you do take the case, you will report only to me?"
11201	'Of course."
11202	My prospective client hesitated, rubbing his fingers against his chin.
11203	His hands were exquisite. 'All right,' he said at last.
11204	'Start at the beginning,' I said. 'Who was murdered?"
11205	Johnny sat up straight, an attentive schoolboy. There was no doubting
11206	his sincerity. He said, 'I was."
11207	It took ten minutes to get the story out of him. When he was finished,
11208	I no longer thought he was crazy. I was. Or I would be if I took the
11209	job.
11210	Johnny - his real name was a code of digits, letters, and cipher bands
11211	longer than my arm - was a cybrid.
11212	I'd heard about cybrids. Who hasn't? I once accused my first husband
11213	of being one. But I never expected to be sitting in the same room with
11214	one. Or to find it so damned attractive.
11215	Johnny was an AI. His consciousness or ego or whatever you want to call
11216	it floated somewhere in the megadatasphere datumplane of TechnoCore.
11217	Like everyone else except maybe the current Senate CEO or the Als'
11218	garbage removers, I had no idea where the TechnoCore was. The Als had
11219	peacefully seceded from human control more than three centuries ago -
11220	before my time- and while they continued to serve the Hegemony as allies
11221	by advising the All Thing, monitoring the dataspheres, occasionally
11222	using their predictive abilities to help us avoid major mistakes or
11223	natural disasters, the TechnoCore generally went about its own
11224	indecipherable and distinctly nonhuman business in privacy.
11225	Fair enough, it seemed to me.
11226	Usually Als do business with humans and human machines via the
11227	datasphere. They can manufacture an interactive holo if they need to -
11228	I remembered during the Maui-Covenant incorporation, the TechnoCore
11229	ambassadors at the treaty signing looked suspiciously like the old holo
11230	star Tyrone Bathwaite.
11231	Cybrids are a whole different matter. Tailored from human genetic
11232	stock, they are far more human in appearance and outward behavior than
11233	androids are allowed to be. Agreements between the TechnoCore and the
11234	Hegemony allow only a handful of cybrids to be in existence.
11235	I looked at Johnny. Fom an AI's perspective, the beautiful body and
11236	intriguing personality sitting across the desk from me must be merely
11237	another appendage, a remote, somewhat more complex but otherwise no more
11238	important than any one of ten thousand such sensors, manipulators,
11239	autonomous units, or other remotes that an AI might use in a day's work.
11240	Discarding 'Johnny' probably would create no more concern in an AI than
11241	clip ping a fingernail would bother me.
11242	What a waste, I thought.
11243	'A cybrid,' I said.
11244	'Yes. Licensed. I have a Worldweb user's visa."
11245	'Good,' I heard myself say. 'And someone... murdered your cybrid and
11246	you want me to f'md out who?"
11247	'No,' said the young man. He had brownish-red curls.
11248	Like his accent, the hairstyle eluded me. It seemed archaic somehow,
11249	but I had seen it somewhere. 'It was not merely
11250	this body that was murdered. My assailant murdered me." 'You?" 'Yes."
11251	'You as in the... ah... AI itself?."
11252	'Precisely."
11253	I didn't get it. Als can't die. Not as far as anyone in the Web knew.
11254	'I don't get it,' I said.
11255	Johnny nodded, 'Unlike a human personality which can . . . I believe
11256	the consensus is . . . be destroyed at death, my own consciousness
11257	cannot be terminated.
11258	There was, however, as a result of the assault, an...
11259	interruption. Although I possessed... ah... shall we say duplicate
11260	recordings of memories, personality, et cetera, there was a loss. Some
11261	data were destroyed in the attack. In that sense, the assailant
11262	committed murder."
11263	'I see,' I lied. I took a breath. 'What about the AI authorities ...
11264	if there are such things ... or the Hegemony cybercops? Wouldn't they
11265	be the ones to go tO?"
11266	'For personal reasons,' said the attractive young man whom I was trying
11267	to see as a cybrid, 'it is important - even necessary - that I do not
11268	consult these sources."
11269	I raised an eyebrow. This sounded more like one of my regular clients.
11270	'I assure you,' he said, 'it is nothing illegal. Nor unethical. Merely
11271	. . . embarrassing to me on a level which I cannot explain."
11272	I folded my arms across my chest. 'Look, Johnny.
11273	This is a pretty half-assed story. I mean, I only have your word that
11274	you're a cybrid. You might be a scam artist for all I know."
11275	He looked surprised. 'I had not thought of that. How would you like me
11276	to show you that I am what I say I am?"
11277	I did not hesitate a second. 'Transfer a million marks to my checking
11278	account in TransWeb,' I said.
11279	Johnny smiled. At the same instant my phone rang and the image of a
11280	harried man with the TransWeb code block floating behind him said,
11281	'Excuse me, M. Lamia, but we wondered with a... ah... deposit of this
11282	size if you would be interested in investigating our long-term savings
11283	options or our mutual assured market possibilities?"
11284	'Later,' I said.
11285	The bank manager nodded and vanished.
11286	'That could've been a simulation,' I said.
11287	Johnny's smile was pleasant. 'Yes, but even that
11288	would be a satisfactory demonstration, would it not?" 'Not necessarily."
11289	He shrugged. 'Assuming I am what I say I am, will you take the case?"
11290	'Yeah." I sighed. 'One thing though. My fee isn't a million marks. I
11291	get five hundred a day plus expenses."
11292	The cybrid nodded. 'Does that mean you will take the case?"
11293	I stood up, put on my hat, and pulled an old coat from a rack by the
11294	window. I bent over the lower desk drawer, smoothly sliding my father's
11295	pistol into a coat pocket.
11296	'Let's go,' I said.
11297	'Yes,' said Johnny. 'Go where?"
11298	'I want to see where you were murdered."
11299	Stereotype has it' that someone born on Lusus hates to leave the Hive
11300	and suffers from instant agoraphobia if we visit anything more open to
11301	the elements that a shopping mall. The truth of it is, most of my
11302	business comes from ... and leads to ... offworld. Skiptracing
11303	deadbeats who use the farcaster system and a change of
11304	identity to try to start over. Finding philandering spouses who think
11305	rendezvousing on a different planet will keep them safe from discovery.
11306	Tracking down missing kids and absent parents.
11307	Still, I was surprised to the point of hesitating a second when we
11308	stepped through the Iron Pig Concourse far-caster onto an empty stone
11309	plateau which seemed to stretch to infinity. Except for the bronze
11310	rectangle of the farcaster portal behind us, there was no sign of
11311	civilization anywhere. The air smelled like rotten eggs. The sky was a
11312	yellow-brown cauldron of sick-looking clouds.
11313	The ground around us was gray and scaled and held no visible life, not
11314	even lichen. I had no idea how far away the horizon really was, but we
11315	felt high and it looked far, and there was no hint of trees, shrubs, or
11316	animal life in the distance either.
11317	'Where the hell are we?" I asked. I had been sure that I knew all of
11318	the worlds in the Web.
11319	'Madhya,' said Johnny, pronouncing it something like 'Mudye."
11320	'I never heard of it,' I said, putting one hand in my pocket and finding
11321	the pearl-handled grip of Dad's automatic.
11322	'It's not officially in the Web yet,' said the cybrid.
11323	'Officially it's a colony of Parvati. But it's only light-minutes from
11324	the FORCE base there and the farcaster connections have been set up
11325	before Madhya joins the Protectorate."
11326	I looked at the desolation. The hydrogen-sulfide stench was making me
11327	ill and I was afraid it was going to ruin my suit. 'Colonies? Nearby?"
11328	'No. There are several small cities on the other side of the planet."
11329	'What's the nearest inhabited area?"
11330	'N.nda Devi. A town of about three hundred people.
11331	It's more than two thousand kilometers to the south." 'Then why put a
11332	farcaster portal here?"
11333	'Potential mining sites,' said Johnny. He gestured toward the gray
11334	plateau. 'Heavy metals. The consortium authorized over a hundred
11335	farcaster portals in this hemisphere for easy access once the
11336	development began."
11337	'Okay,' ! said. 'It's a good place for a murder. Why'd you come
11338	here?"
11339	' I don't know. It was part of the memory section lost." 'Who'd you
11340	come with?" 'I don't know that either." 'What do you know?"
11341	The young man put his graceful hands in his pockets.
11342	'Whoever... whatever... attacked me used a type of
11343	weapon known in the Core as an AIDS II virus." 'What'sthat?"
11344	'AIDS II was a human plague disease back long before the Hegira,' said
11345	Johnny." It disabled the immune system.
11346	This... virus... worksthesamewith anal. Inlessthana second it
11347	infiltrates security systems and turns lethal phagocyte programs against
11348	the host... against the AI itself. Against me."
11349	'So you couldn't have contracted this virus naturally?" Johnny smiled.
11350	'Impossible. l?s comparable to asking a shooting victim if he might not
11351	have fallen on the bullets."
11352	I shrugged." Look, if you want a datumnet or AI expert, you've come to
11353	the wrong woman. Other than accessing the sphere like twenty billion
11354	other chumps, I know zilch about the ghost world." I used the old term
11355	to see if it would get a rise out of him.
11356	'I know,' said Johnny, still equable. 'That's not what I want you to
11357	do."
11358	'What do you want me to do?"
11359	'Find out who brought me here and killed me. And why."
11360	'All right. Why do you think this is where the murder took place?"
11361	'Because this is where I regained control of my cybrid when I was...
11362	reconstituted."
11363	'You mean your cybrid was incapacitated while the
11364	virus destroyed you?"
11365	'Yes."
11366	'And how long did that last?"
11367	'My death? Almost a minute before my reserve persona could be
11368	activated."
11369	I laughed. I couldn't help myself.
11370	'What is amusing, M. Lamia?"
11371	'Your concept of death,' I said.
11372	The hazel eyes looked sad. 'Perhaps it is amusing to you, but you have
11373	no idea what a minute of... disconnection...
11374	means to an element of the TechnoCore.
11375	It is eons of time and information. Millennia of non-communication."
11376	'Yeah,' I said, able to hold back my own tears without too much effort.
11377	'So what did your body, your cybrid do
11378	while you were changing personae tapes or whatever?" 'I presume it was
11379	comatose."
11380	'It can't handle itself autonomously?"
11381	'Oh, yes, but not when there's a general systems failure."
11382	'So where did you come to?"
11383	'Pardon me?"
11384	'When you reactivated the cybrid, where was it?" Johnny nodded in
11385	understanding. He pointed to a boulder less than five meters from the
11386	farcaster. 'Lying there."
11387	'Oh this side or the other side?"
11388	'The other side."
11389	I went over and examined the spot. No blood. No notes. No murder
11390	weapons left lying about. Not even a footprint or indication that
11391	Johnny's body had lain there for that eternity of a minute. A police
11392	forensics team might have read volumes into the microscopic and biotic
11393	clues left there, but all I could see was hard rock.
11394	'If your memory's really gone,' I said, 'how do you
11395	know someone else came here with you?"
11396	'I accessed the farcaster records."
11397	'Did you bother to check the mystery person or person's name on the
11398	universal card charge?"
11399	'We both farcast on my card,' said Johnny.
11400	'Just one other person?" 'Yes."
11401	I nodded. Farcaster records would solve every inter-world crime if the
11402	portals were true teleportation; the transport data record could have
11403	re-created the subject down to the last gram and follicle. Instead, a
11404	farcaster essentially is just a crude hole ripped in space/time by a
11405	phased singularity. If the farcaster criminal doesn't use
11406	his or her own card, the only data we get are origination and
11407	destination.
11408	'Where'd you two farcast from?" I asked.
11409	'Tau Ceti Center."
11410	'You have the portal code?"
11411	'Of course."
11412	'Let's go there and finish this conversation,' I said.
11413	'This place stinks to high heaven."
11414	TC, the age-old nickname for Tau Ceti Center, is certainly the most
11415	crowded world in the Web. Besides its population of five billion people
11416	scrabbling for room on less than half the land area of Old Earth, it has
11417	an orbital ring ecology that is home for half a billion more. In
11418	addition to being the capital of the Hegemony and home of the Senate,
11419	TC2 is the business nexus for Webtrade.
11420	Naturally the portal number Johnny had found brought us to a
11421	six-hundred-portal terminex in one of the biggest spires in New London,
11422	one of the oldest and largest city sections.
11423	'Hell,' I said, 'let's get a drink."
11424	There was a choice of bars near the terminex and I picked one that was
11425	relatively quiet: a simulated 'ship's tavern, dark, cool, with plenty of
11426	fake wood and brass. I ordered a beer. I never drink the hard stuff or
11427	use Flashback when on a case. Sometimes I think that need for
11428	self-discipline is what keeps me in the business.
11429	Johnny also ordered a beer, a dark, German brew bottled on Renaissance
11430	Vector. I found myself wondering what vices a cybrid might have. I
11431	said:
11432	'What else did you find out before coming to see me?" The young man
11433	opened his hands. 'Nothing."
11434	'Shit,' I said reverently. 'This is a joke. With all the powers of an
11435	AI at your disposal, you can't trace your cybrid's whereabouts and
11436	actions for a few days prior to your... accident?"
11437	'No." Johnny sipped his beer. 'Rather, I could but there are important
11438	reasons why I. do not want my fellow Als to find me investigating."
11439	'You suspect one of them?"
11440	Instead of answering, Johnny handed me a flimsy of his universal card
11441	purchases. 'The blackout caused by my murder left five standard days
11442	unaccounted for.
11443	Here are the card charges for that time."
11444	'I thought you said you were only disconnected for a minute."
11445	Johnny scratched his cheek with one finger. 'I was lucky to lose only
11446	five days' worth of data,' he said.
11447	I waved over the human waiter and ordered another beer. 'Look,' I said,
11448	'Johnny... whoever you are, VII never be able to get an angle on this
11449	case unless I know more about you and your situation. Why would someone
11450	want to kill you if they know you'll be reconstituted or whatever the
11451	hell it is?"
11452	'I see two possible motives,' said Johnny over his beer.
11453	I nodded. 'One would be to create just the memory loss they succeeded
11454	in getting,' I said. 'That would suggest that, whatever it was they
11455	wanted you to forget, it'd occurred or come to your attention in the
11456	past week or so. What's the second motive?"
11457	'To send me a message,' said Johnny. 'I just don't know what it is. Or
11458	from whom."
11459	'Do you know who would want to kill you?"
11460	'No."
11461	'No guesses at all?"
11462	'None."
11463	'Most murders,' I said, 'are acts of sudden, mindless rage committed by
11464	someone the victim knows well.
11465	Family. A friend or lover. A majority of the premeditated ones are
11466	usually carried out by someone close to the victim."
11467	Johnny said nothing. There was something about his face that I found
11468	incredibly attractive - a sort of masculine strength combined with a
11469	feminine sense of awareness.
11470	Perhaps it was the eyes.
11471	'Do Als have families?" I asked. 'Feuds? Squabbles?
11472	Lovers' spats?"
11473	'No." He smiled slightly. 'There are quasi-family arrangements, but
11474	they share none of the requirements of emotion or responsibility that
11475	human families exhibit.
11476	AI "families" are primarily convenient code groups for showing where
11477	certain processing trends originated."
11478	350.
11479	'So you don't think another AI attacked you?"
11480	'It's possible." Johnny rotated his glass in his hands. 'I just do not
11481	see why they would attack me through my cybrid."
11482	'Easier access?"
11483	'Perhaps· But it complicates things for the assailant.
11484	An attack in datumplane would have been infinitely more lethal. Also, I
11485	do fail to see any motive for another AI. It makes no sense. I'm a
11486	threat to no one."
11487	'Why do you have a cybrid, Johnny? Maybe if I understood your role in
11488	things, I could get a motive·'
11489	He picked up a pretzel and played with it. 'I have a cybrid... in some
11490	ways I am a cybrid, because my...
11491	function... is to observe and react to human beings. In a sense, I was
11492	human once myself."
11493	I frowned and shook my head. So far nothing he'd said had made sense·
11494	'You've heard of personality retrieval projects?" he asked.
11495	'No."
11496	'A standard year ago, when the FORCE sims re-created the personality of
11497	General Horace Glennon-Height to see what made him such a brilliant
11498	general? It was in all
11499	the news·'
11500	'Yeah."
11501	'Well, I am... or was... an earlier and much more complicated
11502	retrieval project. My core persona was based on a pre-Hegira Old Earth
11503	poet. Ancient. Born late eighteenth century Old Calendar."
11504	'How the hell can they reconstruct a personality that lost in time?"
11505	'Writings,' said Johnny· 'His letters. Diaries. Critical biographies.
11506	Testimony of friends. But mostly through his verse. The sim re-creates
11507	the environment, plugs in the known factors, and works backward from the
11508	creative products. Voild - a persona core. Crude at first but, by the
11509	time I came into being, relatively refined. Our first attempt was a
11510	twentieth-century poet named Ezra Pound. Our persona was opinionated to
11511	the point of absurdity, prejudiced beyond rationality, and functionally
11512	insane. It took a year of tinkering before we
11513	discovered that the persona was accurate; it was the man who had been
11514	nuts. A genius but nuts'
11515	'And then what?" I said. 'They build your personality around a dead
11516	poet. Then what?"
11517	'This becomes the template upon which the AI is grown,' said Johnny.
11518	'The cybrid allows me to carry out
11519	my role in the datumplane community."
11520	'As poet?"
11521	Johnny smiled again. 'More as poem,' he said.
11522	'A poem?"
11523	'An ongoing work of art... but not in the human sense· A puzzle
11524	perhaps. A variable enigma which occasionally offers unusual insights
11525	into more serious lines of analysis."
11526	'I don't get it,' I said.
11527	'It probably does not matter. I very much doubt if my
11528	· . . purpose... was the cause of the assault·' 'What do you think
11529	was the cause?" 'I have no idea."
11530	I felt us closing a circle. 'All right,' I said. 'I'II try to find out
11531	what you were doing and who you were with during these lost five days.
11532	Is there anything besides the credit flimsy that you can think of to
11533	help?"
11534	Johnny shook his head. 'You know, of course, why it is important for me
11535	to know the identity and motive of my assailant?"
11536	'Sure,' I said, 'they might try it again."
11537	'Precisely."
11538	'How can I get hold of you if I need to?" Johnny passed me an access
11539	chip.
11540	'A secure line?" ! said.
11541	' Very. '
11542	'Okay,' I said, 'I'II get back to you if and when I get some
11543	information."
11544	We moved out of the bar and toward the terminex. He was moving away
11545	when I took three quick steps and grabbed his arm. It was the first
11546	time that I had touched him. 'Johnny. What's the name of the Old Earth
11547	poet
11548	they resurrected..."
11549	'Retrieved."
11550	'Whatever. The one they built your AI persona on?"
11551	The attractive cybrid hesitated. I noticed that his eyelashes were very
11552	long. 'How can it be important?" he asked.
11553	'Who knows what's important?"
11554	He nodded. 'Keats,' he said. 'Born in A.D. I795. Died of
11555	tuberculosis in I82I. John Keats."
11556	Following someone through a series of farcaster changes is damn near
11557	impossible. Especially if you want to remain undetected. The Web cops
11558	can do it, given about fifty agents assigned to the task, plus some
11559	exotic and damned expensive high-tech toys, not to mention the
11560	cooperation of the Transit Authority. For a solo, the task is almost
11561	impossible.
11562	Still, it was fairly important for me to see where my new client was
11563	headed.
11564	Johnny did not look back as he crossed the terminex plaza. I moved to a
11565	nearby kiosk and watched through my pocket-sized imager as he punched
11566	codes on a manual diskey, inserted his card, and stepped through the
11567	glowing rectangle.
11568	The use of the manual diskey probably meant that he was headed for a
11569	general access portal since private 'caster codes are usually imprinted
11570	on eyes-only chips.
11571	Great. I'd narrowed his destination down to approximately two million
11572	portals on a hundred and fifty-some Web worlds and half that many moons.
11573	With one hand I pulled the red 'lining' out of my overcoat while I hit
11574	replay on the imager, watching through the eyepiece as it magnified the
11575	diskey sequence.
11576	I tugged out a red cap to go with my new red jacket and pulled the brim
11577	low over my face. Moving quickly across the plaza, I queried my comlog
11578	about the nine-digit transfer code I'd seen on the imager. I knew the
11579	first three digits meant the world of Tsingtao-Hsishuang Parma -I'd
11580	memorized all the planetary prefixes - and was told an instant later
11581	that the portal code led to a residential district in the First
11582	Expansion city of Wansiehn.
11583	I hurried to the first open booth and 'cast there, stepping out onto a
11584	small terminex plaza paved in worn brick. Ancient oriental shops leaned
11585	against one
11586	another, caves of their pagoda roofs hanging over narrow side streets.
11587	People thronged the plaza and stood in doorways and, while most of those
11588	in sight were obviously descendants of the Long Flight exiles who
11589	settled THP, many were offworlders. The air smelled of alien
11590	vegetation, sewage, and cooking rice.
11591	'Damn,' I whispered. There were three other farcaster portals there and
11592	none were in constant use. Johnny could have farcast out immediately.
11593	Instead of 'casting back to Lusus, I spent a few minutes checking the
11594	plaza and side streets. By this time the melanin pill I'd swallowed had
11595	worked and I was a young black woman - or man, it was hard to tell in my
11596	trendy red balloon jacket and polarized visor, strolling idly while
11597	taking pictures with my tourist imager.
11598	The trace pellet I'd dissolved in Johnny's second German beer had had
11599	more than enough time to work. The UV-positive microspores were almost
11600	hanging in the air by now - I could almost follow the trail of
11601	exhalations he had left. Instead, I found a bright yellow handprint on
11602	a dark wall (bright yellow to my especially fitted visor of course,
11603	invisible out of the UV spectrum) and then followed the trail of vague
11604	blotches where saturated clothing had touched market stalls or stone.
11605	Johnny was eating in a Cantonese restaurant less than two blocks from
11606	the terminex plaza. The frying food smelled delicious but I restrained
11607	myself from entering - checking prices in alley bookstalls and haggling
11608	in the market for almost an hour before he finished, returned to the
11609	plaza, and farcast out. This time he used a chip code - a private
11610	portal, certainly, possibly a private home - and I two took chances by
11611	using my pilot-fish card to follow him. Two chances because first the
11612	card is totally illegal and would someday cost me my license if caught -
11613	less than likely if I kept using Daddy Silva's obscenely expensive but
11614	aesthetically perfect shapechanger chips - and, second, I ran a better
11615	than even chance of ending up in the living room of Johnny's house ...
11616	never an easy situation to talk one's way out of.
11617	It was not his living room. Even before I'd located the
11618	street signs I recognized the familiar extra tug of gravity, the dim,
11619	bronze light, the scent of oil and ozone in the air, and knew I was home
11620	on Lusus.
11621	Johnny had 'cast into a medium-security private residential tower in one
11622	of the Bergson Hives. Perhaps that was why he'd chosen my agency- we
11623	were almost neighbors, less than six hundred klicks apart.
11624	My cybrid was not in sight. I walked purposefully so as not to alert
11625	any security vids programmed to respond to loitering. There was no
11626	residents' directory, no numbers or names on the apartment doorways, and
11627	no listings accessible by comlog. I guessed that there were about
11628	twenty thousand residential cubbies in East Bergson Hive.
11629	The telltales were fading as the spore soup died, but I checked only two
11630	of the radial corridors before I found a trail. Johnny lived far out on
11631	a glass-floored wing above a methane lake. His palmlock showed a
11632	faintly glowing handprint. I used my cat-burglar tools to take a
11633	reading of the lock and then I 'cast home.
11634	All in all, I'd watched my man go out for Chinese food and then go home
11635	for the night. Enough accomplished for one day.
11636	BB Surbringer was my Al expert. BB worked in Hegemony Flow Control
11637	Records and Statistics and spent most of his life reclining on a
11638	free-fall couch with half a dozen microleads running from his skull
11639	while he communed with other bureaucrats in datumplane. I'd known him
11640	in college when he was a pure cyberpuke, a twentieth-generation hacker,
11641	cortically shunted when he was twelve standard. His real name was
11642	Ernest but he'd earned the nickname BB when he went out with a friend of
11643	mine named Shayla Toyo. Shayla'd seen him naked on their second date
11644	and had laughed for a solid half hour: Ernest was - and is - almost two
11645	meters tall but masses less than fifty kilos. Shayla said that he had a
11646	butt like two BBs and - like most cruel things do - the nickname stuck.
11647	I visited him in one of the windowless worker monoliths on TC2. No
11648	cloud towers for BB and his ilk.
11649	'So, Brawne,' he said, 'how come you're getting information-literate in
11650	your old age? You're too old to get a real job."
11651	'I just want to know about-Als, BB."
11652	'Only one of the most complex topics in the known universe,' he sighed
11653	and looked longingly at his disconnected neural shunt and metacortex
11654	leads.
11655	Cyberpukes never come down, but civil servants are required to dismount
11656	for lunch. BB was like most cyberpukes in that he never felt
11657	comfortable exchanging information when he wasn't riding a data wave.
11658	'So what do you want to know?" he said.
11659	'Why did the Als drop out?" I had to start somewhere.
11660	BB made a convoluted gesture with his hands. 'They said they had
11661	projects which were not compatible with total immersion in Hegemony -
11662	read human - affairs.
11663	Truth is, nobody knows."
11664	'But they're still around. Still managing things?" 'Sure. The system
11665	couldn't run without them. You know that, Brawne. Even the All Thing
11666	couldn't work without AI management of the real-time Schwarzschild
11667	patterning..."
11668	'Okay,' I said, cutting him off before he lapsed into cyberpukese, 'but
11669	what are their "other projects"?"
11670	'No one knows. Branner and Swayze up at ArtIntel Corp think that the
11671	Als are pursuing the evolution of consciousness on a galactic scale. We
11672	know they have their own probes out far deeper into the Outback than..."
11673	'What about cybrids?"
11674	'Cybrids?" BB sat up and looked interested for the first time. 'Why do
11675	you mention cybrids?"
11676	'Why are you surprised that I mentioned them, BB?" He absently rubbed
11677	his shunt socket. 'Well, first of all, most people forget they exist.
11678	Two centuries ago it was all alarmism and pod people taking over and all
11679	that, but now nobody thinks about them. Also, I just ran across an
11680	anomaly advisory yesterday that said that cybrids were disappearing."
11681	'Disappearing?" It was my turn to sit up.
11682	'You know, being phased out. The Als used to maintain
11683	about a thousand licensed cybrids in the Web. About half of them based
11684	right here on TC2. Last week's census showed about two thirds of
11685	those'd been recalled in the past month or so."
11686	'What happens when an AI recalls its cybrid?"
11687	'I dunno. They're destroyed, I suppose. AIs don't like to waste
11688	things, so I imagine the genetic material's recycled somehow."
11689	'Why are they being recycled?"
11690	'Nobody knows, Brawne. But then most of us don't
11691	know why the AIs do most of the things they do."
11692	'Do experts see them - the AIs - as a threat?"
11693	'Are you kidding? Six hundred years ago, maybe. Two centuries ago the
11694	Secession made us leery. But if the things wanted to hurt humanity,
11695	they could're done it long before this. Worrying about Als turning on
11696	us is about as productive as worrying that farm animals are going to
11697	revolt."
11698	'Except the Als are smarter than us,' I said.
11699	'Yeah, well, there is that."
11700	'BB, have you heard of personality retrieval projects?" 'Like the
11701	Glennon-Height thing? Sure. Everyone has.
11702	I even worked on one at Reichs University a few years
11703	ago. But they're passe. No one's doing them anymore." 'Why's that?"
11704	'Jesus, you don't know shit about anything, do you, Brawne? The
11705	personality retrieval projects were all washouts. Even with the best
11706	sim control... they got the FORCE OCS:HTN network involved... you
11707	can't factor all variables successfully. The persona template becomes
11708	self-aware . . . I don't mean just self-aware, like you and me, but
11709	self-aware that it's an artificially self-aware persona - and that leads
11710	to terminal Strange Loops and nonharmonic labyrinths that go straight to
11711	Escher-space."
11712	'Translate,' I said.
11713	BB sighed and glanced at the blue and gold time band on the wall. Five
11714	minutes and his mandatory lunch hour was over. He could rejoin the real
11715	world. 'Translated,' he said, 'the retrieved personality breaks down.
11716	Goes crazy. Psycho City. Bugfuck."
11717	'All of them?"
11718	'All of them."
11719	'But the Als are still interested in the process?"
11720	'Oh, yeah? Who says? They've never done one. All the retrieval
11721	efforts I've ever heard of were human-run...
11722	mostly botched university projects. Brain-dead academics spending
11723	fortunes to bring back dead academic brains."
11724	I forced a smile. 'There were three minutes until he could plug back
11725	in. 'Were all the retrieved personalities given cybrid remotes?"
11726	'Uh-uh. What gave you that idea, Brawne? None
11727	were. Couldn't work."
11728	'Why not?"
11729	'It'd just fuck up the stimsim. Plus you'd need perfect clone stock and
11730	an interactive environment precise to the last detail. You see, kiddo,
11731	with a retrieved personality, you let it live in its world via
11732	full-scale sim and then you just sneaked a few questions in via dreams
11733	or scenario interactives. Pulling a persona out of sim reality into
11734	slow time..."
11735	This was the cyberpukes' age-old term for the . . .
11736	pardon the expression... real world.
11737	'... would just drive it bugfuck all the sooner,' he finished.
11738	I shook my head. 'Yeah, well, thanks, BB." I moved to the door. There
11739	were thirty seconds left before my old college friend could escape from
11740	slow time.
11741	'BB,' I said as an afterthought, 'have you ever heard of a persona
11742	retrieved from an Old Earth poet named John Keats?"
11743	'Keats? Oh, sure there was a big write-up on that in my undergrad text.
11744	Marti Carollus did that about fifty years
11745	ago at New Cambridge."
11746	'What happened?"
11747	'The usual. Persona went Strange Loop. But before it broke up it died
11748	a full sim death. Some ancient disease." BB glanced at the clock,
11749	smiled, and lifted his shunt.
11750	Before clicking it into his skull socket he looked at me again, almost
11751	beatifically. 'I remember now,' he said through his dreamy smile, 'it
11752	was tuberculosis."
11753	If our society ever opted for Orwell's Big Brother approach, the
11754	instrument of choice for oppression would have to be the credit wake. In
11755	a totally noncash economy with only a vestigial barter black market, a
11756	person's activities could be tracked in real time by monitoring the
11757	credit wake of his or her universal card. There were strict laws
11758	protecting card privacy but laws had a bad habit of being ignored or
11759	abrogated when societal push came to totalitarian shove.
11760	Johnny's credit wake for the five-day period leading to his murder
11761	showed a man of regular habits and modest expenses. Before following up
11762	the leads on the credit flimsy l'd spent a dull two days following
11763	Johnny himself.
11764	Data: He lived alone in East Bergson Hive. A routine check showed that
11765	he'd lived there about seven local months - less than five standard. In
11766	the morning he had breakfast at a local cafe and then farcast to
11767	Renaissance Vector where he worked for about five hours, evidently
11768	gathering research of some sort in the print archives, followed by a
11769	light lunch at a courtyard vendor's stand, another hour or two in the
11770	library, and then 'cast home to Lusus or to some favorite eating spot on
11771	another world. In his cubby by 2200 hours. More farcasting than the
11772	average Lusian middle-class drone, but an otherwise uninspiring
11773	schedule. The credit flimsies confirmed that he had held to the agenda
11774	on the week he was murdered, with the addition of a few extra purchases
11775	- shoes one day, groceries the next - and one stop at a bar on
11776	Renaissance V on the day of his 'murder."
11777	I joined him for dinner at the small restaurant on Red Dragon Street
11778	near the Tsingtao-Hsishuang Panna por tal. The food was very hot, very
11779	spicy, and very good.
11780	'How is it going,' he asked.
11781	'Great. l'm a thousand marks richer than when we met and I found a good
11782	Cantonese restaurant."
11783	'I'm glad my money is going toward something important."
11784	'Speaking of your money... where does it come from?
11785	Hanging out in a Renaissance Vector library can't pay much."
11786	Johnny raised an eyebrow. 'I live on a small ...
11787	inheritance."
11788	'Not too small, I hope. I want to be paid."
11789	'It will be adequate for our purposes, M. Lamia. Have you discovered
11790	anything of interest?"
11791	I shrugged. 'Tell me what you do in that library." 'Can it possibly be
11792	germane?" 'Yeah, could be."
11793	He looked at me strangely. Something about his eyes made me go weak at
11794	the knees. 'You remind me of someone,' he said softly.
11795	'Oh?" From anyone else that line would have been cause for an exit.
11796	'Who?" I asked.
11797	'A... woman I once knew. Long ago." He brushed fingers across his brow
11798	as if he were suddenly tired or dizzy.
11799	'What was her name?"
11800	'Fanny." The word was almost whispered.
11801	I knew who he was talking about. John Keats had a fiancce named Fanny.
11802	Their love affair had been a series of romantic frustrations which
11803	almost drove the poet mad. When he died in Italy, alone except for one
11804	fellow traveler, feeling abandoned by friends and his lover, Keats had
11805	asked that unopened letters from Fanny and a lock of her hair be buried
11806	with him.
11807	l'd never heard of John Keats before this week; I'd accessed all this
11808	shit with my comlog. I said, 'So what do you do at the library?"
11809	The cybrid cleared his throat. 'l'm researching a
11810	poem. Searching for fragments of the original." 'Something by Keats?"
11811	'Yes."
11812	'Wouldn't it be easier to access it?"
11813	'Of course. But it is important for me to see the original...
11814	to touch it."
11815	I thought about that. 'What's the poem about?"
11816	He smiled... or at least his lips did. The hazel eyes still seemed
11817	troubled. 'It's called Hyperion. It's difficult to describe what it's
11818	about. Artistic failure, I suppose.
11819	Keats never finished it."
11820	I pushed aside my plate and sipped warm tea. 'You say
11821	Keats never finished it. Don't you mean you never finished it?"
11822	His look of shock had to be genuine... unless Als were consummate
11823	actors. For all I knew, they could be.
11824	'Good God,' he said, 'I'm not John Keats. Having a persona based upon a
11825	retrieval template no more makes me Keats than having the name Lamia
11826	makes you a monster.
11827	There've been a million influences that have separated me from that
11828	poor, sad genius."
11829	'You said I reminded you of Fanny."
11830	'An echo of a dream. Less. You've taken RNA learn ing medication,
11831	yes?"
11832	,yes.,
11833	'It's like that. Memories which feel... hollow."
11834	A human waiter brought fortune cookies.
11835	'Do you have any interest in visiting the real
11836	Hyperion?" I asked.
11837	'What's that?"
11838	'The Outback world. Somewhere beyond Parvati, I think."
11839	Johnny looked puzzled. He had broken open the cookie but had not yet
11840	read the fortune.
11841	'It used to be called Poets' World, I think,' I said. 'It even has a
11842	city named after you... after Keats."
11843	The young man shook his head. 'I'm sorry, I haven't heard of the
11844	place."
11845	'How can that be? Don't Als know everything?"
11846	His laugh was short and sharp. 'This one knows very little." He read
11847	his fortune: BE WARY OF SUDDEN IMPULSES.
11848	I crossed my arms. 'You know, except for that parlor trick with the
11849	bank manager holo, I have no proof that
11850	you are what you say you are." 'Give me your hand." 'My hand?"
11851	'Yes. Either one. Thank you."
11852	Johnny held my right hand in both of his. His fingers
11853	were longer than mine. Mine were stronger.
11854	'Close your eyes,' he said.
11855	I did. There was no transition: one instant I was sitting in the Blue
11856	Lotus on Red Dragon Street and the next I
11857	was... nowhere. Somewhere. Streaking through gray-blue datumplane,
11858	banking along chrome-yellow information highways, passing over and under
11859	and titrough great cities of glowing information storage, red
11860	skyscrapers sheathed in black security ice, simple entities like
11861	personal accounts or corporate files blazing like burning refineries in
11862	the night. Above it all, just out of sight as if poised in twisted
11863	space, hung the gigantic weights of the AIs, their simplest
11864	communications pulsing like violent heat lightning along the infinite
11865	horizons.
11866	Somewhere in the distance, all but lost in the maze of three-dimensional
11867	neon that partitioned one tiny second of arc in the incredible
11868	datasphere of one small world, I sensed rather than saw those soft,
11869	hazel eyes waiting for me.
11870	Johnny released my hand. He cracked my fortune cookie open. The strip
11871	of paper read: INVEST WISELY IN NEW VENTURES.
11872	'Jesus,' I whispered. BB had taken me flying in datumplane before, but
11873	without a shunt the experience had been a shadow of this. It was the
11874	difference between watching a black and white holo of fireworks display
11875	and being there. 'How do you do that?"
11876	'Will you be making any progress on the case tomorrow?" he asked.
11877	I regained my composure. 'Tomorrow,' I said, 'I I0Ian to solve it."
11878	Well, maybe not solve it, but at least get things moving.
11879	The last charge on Johnny's credit flimsy had been the bar on
11880	Renaissance V. I'd checked it out the first day, of course, talked to
11881	several of the regulars since there was no human bartender, but had come
11882	up with no one who remembered Johnny. I'd been back twice with no
11883	greater luck. But on the third day I went back to stay until something
11884	broke.
11885	The bar was definitely not in the class of the wood and brass place
11886	Johnny and I had visited on TC2. This place was tucked on a second
11887	floor of a decaying building in a run-down neighborhood two blocks from
11888	the Renaissance library where Johnny spent his days. Not the kind
11889	of place he would stop in on the way to the farcaster plaza, but just
11890	the kind of place he might end up if he met someone in or near the
11891	library - someone who wanted to talk in private.
11892	l'd been there six hours and was getting damned tired of salted nuts and
11893	fiat beer when an old derelict came in.
11894	I guessed that he was a regular by the way he didn't pause in the
11895	doorway or look around, but headed straight for a small table in the bak
11896	and ordered a whiskey before the serving mech had come to a full stop.
11897	When I joined him at the table I realized that he wasn't so much a
11898	derelict as an example of the tired men and women .I'd seen in the junk
11899	shops and street stalls in that neighborhood. He
11900	squinted up at me through defeated eyes.
11901	'May I sit down?"
11902	'Depends, sister. What're you selling?"
11903	'l'm buying." I sat, set my beer mug on the table, and slid across a
11904	fiat photo of Johnny entering the farcaster booth on TC2. 'Seen this
11905	guy?"
11906	The old man Danced at the photo and returned his full attention to his
11907	whiskey. 'Maybe."
11908	I waved over the mech for another round. 'If you did see him, it's your
11909	lucky day."
11910	The old man snoed and rubbed the back of his hand against the gray
11911	stubble on his cheek. 'If it is, it'll be the first time in a long
11912	fucking time." He focused on me.
11913	'How much? For what?"
11914	'Information. How much depends on the information.
11915	Have you seen him?" I removed a black market
11916	fifty-mark bill from my tunic pocket.
11917	'eaho'
11918	The bill came down to the table but remained in my hand. 'When?"
11919	'Last Tuesday. Tuesday morning."
11920	That was the correct day. I slid the fifty marks to him and removed
11921	another bill. 'Was he alone?"
11922	The old man licked his lips. 'Let me think. I don't think... no, he
11923	was there." He pointed toward a table at the rear. 'Two other guys with
11924	him. One of them...
11925	well, that's why I remembered."
11926	'What's that?"
11927	The old man rubbed finger and thumb in a gesture as old as greed.
11928	'Tell me about the two men,' I coaxed.
11929	'The young guy... your guy... he was with one of them, you know, the
11930	nature freaks with robes. You see'em on HTV all the time. Them and
11931	their damn trees."
11932	Trees? 'A Templar?" I said, astounded. What would a Templar be doing
11933	in a Renaissance V bar? If he'd been after Johnny, why would he wear
11934	his robe? That would be like a murderer going out to do business in a
11935	clown suit.
11936	'Yeah. Templar. Brown robe, sort of oriental-looking." 'A man?"
11937	'Yeah, I said he was."
11938	'Can you describe him more?"
11939	'Nah, Templar. Tall son of a bitch. Couldn't see his face very well."
11940	'What about the other one?"
11941	The old man shrugged. I removed a second bill and set them both near my
11942	glass.
11943	'Did they come in together?" I prompted. 'The three of them?"
11944	'I don't... I can't... No, wait. Your guy and the Templar guy came in
11945	first. I remember seeing the robe
11946	before the other guy sat down."
11947	'Describe the other man."
11948	The old man waved over the mech and ordered a third drink. I used my
11949	card and the servitor slid away on noisy repellers.
11950	'Like you,' he said. 'Sort of like you."
11951	'Short?" I said. 'Strong arms and legs? A Lusian?" 'Yeah. I guess so.
11952	Never been there." 'What else?"
11953	' No hair,' said the old man." Just a whattyacallit like my
11954	niece used to wear. A pony tail."
11955	'A queue,' I said.
11956	'Yeah. Whatever." He started to reach for the bills.
11957	'Couple more questions. Did they argue?"
11958	'Nab. Don't think so. Talked real quiet. Place's pretty empty that
11959	time of day."
11960	'What time of day was it ?"
11961	'Morning. About ten o'clock."
11962	This coincided with the credit flimsy code.
11963	'Did you hear any of the conversation?" 'Uh-uh."
11964	'Who did most of the talking?"
11965	The old man took a drink and furrowed his brow in thought. 'Templar guy
11966	did at first. Your man seemed to be answering questions. Seemed
11967	surprised once when I was looking."
11968	'Shocked?"
11969	'Uh-uh, just surprised. Like the guy in the robe'd said something he
11970	didn't expect."
11971	'You said the Templar did most of the talking at first.
11972	Who spoke later? My guy?"
11973	'Uh-uh, the one with the pony tail. Then they left." 'All three of them
11974	left?"
11975	'Nah. Your guy and the pony tail."
11976	'The Templar stayed behind?"
11977	'Yeah. I guess so. I think. I went to the lay. When I got back I
11978	don't think he was there."
11979	'What way did the other two go?"
11980	'I don't know, goddammit. I wasn't paying much attention. I was having
11981	a drink, not playing spy!'
11982	I nodded. The mech rolled over again but I waved it away. The old man
11983	scowled at its back.
11984	'So they weren't arguing when they left? No sign of a
11985	disagreement or that one was forcing the other to leave?" 'Who?"
11986	'My guy and the queue."
11987	'Uh-uh. Shit, I don't know." Hc looked down at the bills in his grimy
11988	hand and at the whiskey in the mech's display panel, realizing, perhaps,
11989	that he wasn't going to get any more of either from me. 'Why do you
11990	want to know all this shit, anyway?"
11991	Tm looking for the guy,' I said. I looked around the bar. About twenty
11992	customers sat at tables. Most of them looked like neighborhood
11993	regulars. 'Anyone else here who might've seen them? Or somebody else
11994	you might remember who was here?"
11995	'Uh-uh,' he said dully. I realized then that the old man's eyes were
11996	precisely the color of the whiskey he'd been drinking.
11997	I stood, set a final twenty-mark bill on the table.
11998	'Thanks, friend."
11999	'Any time, sister."
12000	The mech was rolling toward him before l'd reached the door.
12001	I walked back toward the library, paused a minute in the busy farcaster
12002	plaza, and stood there a minute. Scenario so far: Johnny had met the
12003	Templar or been approached by him, either in the library or outside when
12004	he arrived in midmorning. They went somewhere private to talk, the bar,
12005	and something the Templar said surprised Johnny.
12006	A man with a queue - possibly a Lusian - showed up and took over the
12007	conversation. Johnny and Queue left together. Sometime after that,
12008	Johnny farcast to TC2 and then farcast from there with one other person
12009	- possibly Queue or the Templar - to Madhya where someone tried to kill
12010	him. Did kill him.
12011	Too many gaps. Too many 'someones." Not a hell of a lot to show for a
12012	day's work.
12013	I was debating whether to 'cast back to Lusus when my comlog chirped on
12014	the restricted comm frequency I'd given to Johnny.
12015	His voice was raw. 'M. Lamia. Come quickly, please.
12016	I think they've just tried again. To kill me." The coordinates which
12017	followed were for the East Bergson Hive.
12018	I ran for the farcaster.
12019	The door to Johnny's cubby was open a crack. There was no one in the
12020	corridor, no sounds from the apartment.
12021	Whatever had happened hadn't brought the authorities yet.
12022	I brought out Dad's automatic pistol from my coat pocket, jacked a round
12023	info the chamber, and clicked on the laser targeting beam with a single
12024	motion.
12025	I went in low, both arms extended, the red dot sliding across the dark
12026	walls, a cheap print on the far wall, a darker hall leading into the
12027	cubby. The foyer was empty.
12028	The living room and media pit were empty.
12029	Johnny lay on the floor of the bedroom, his head against the bed. Blood
12030	soaked the sheet. He struggled to
12031	prop himself up, fell back. The sliding door behind him was open and a
12032	dank industrial wind blew in from the open mall beyond.
12033	I checked the single closet, short hall, kitchen niche, and came back to
12034	step out on the balcony. The view was spectacular from the perch two
12035	hundred or so meters up the curved Hive wall, looking down the ten or
12036	twenty kilometers of the Trench Mall. The roof of the Hive was a dark
12037	mass of girders another hundred or so meters above. Thousands of
12038	lights, commercial hoios, and neon lights glowed from the mall, joining
12039	in the haze of dis rance to a brilliant, throbbing electric blur.
12040	There were hundreds of similar balconies on this wall of the Hive, all
12041	deserted. The nearest was twenty meters away. They were the kind of
12042	thing rental agents like to point to as a plus - God knows that Johnny
12043	probably paid plenty extra for an outside room - but the balconies were
12044	totally impractical because of the strong wind rushing up toward the
12045	ventilators, carrying the usual grit and debris as well as the eternal
12046	Hive scent of oil and ozone.
12047	I put my pistol away and went back to check on Johnny.
12048	The cut ran from his hairline to his eyebrow, superficial but messy. He
12049	was sitting up as I returned from the bathroom with a sterile drypad and
12050	pressed it against the cut. 'What happened?" I said.
12051	'Two men... were waiting in the bedroom when I came in. They'd
12052	bypassed the alarms on the balcony door."
12053	'You deserve a refund on your security tax,' I said.
12054	'What happened next?"
12055	'We struggled. They seemed to be dragging me toward the door. One of
12056	them had an injector but I managed to knock it out of his hand."
12057	'What made them leave?"
12058	'I activated the in-house alarms."
12059	'But not Hive security?"
12060	'No. I didn't want them involved."
12061	'Who hit you?"
12062	Johnny smiled sheepishly. 'I did. They released me, I went after them.
12063	I managed to trip and fall against the nightstand."
12064	'Not a very graceful brawl on either side,' I said. I switched on a
12065	lamp and checked the carpet until I found
12066	the injection ampule where it had rolled under the bed.
12067	Johnny eyed it as if it were a viper.
12068	'What's your guess?" I said. 'More AIDS II?"
12069	He shook his head.
12070	'I know a place where we can get it analyzed,' I said.
12071	'My guess is that it's just a hypnotic trank. They just wanted you to
12072	come along... not to kill you."
12073	Johnny moved the drypad and grimaced. The blood was still flowing. 'Why
12074	would anyone want to kidnap a cybrid?"
12075	'You tell me. I'm beginning to think that the so-called
12076	murder was just a botched kidnapping attempt." Johnny shook his head
12077	again.
12078	I said, 'Did one of the men wear a queue?"
12079	'I don't know. They wore caps and osmosis masks."
12080	'Was either one tall enough to be a Templar or strong enough to be a
12081	Lusian?"
12082	'A Templar?" Johnny was surprised. 'No. One was about average Web
12083	height. The one with the ampule could have been Lusian. Strong
12084	enough."
12085	'So you went after a Lusian thug with your bare hands. Do you have some
12086	bioprocessors or augmenta tion implants I don't know about?"
12087	'No. I was just mad."
12088	I helped him to his feet. 'So Als get angry?"
12089	'I do."
12090	'Come on,' I said, 'I know an automated med clinic that's discount. Then
12091	you'll be staying with me for a while."
12092	'With you7 Why?"
12093	'Because you've graduated from just needing a detective,' I said. 'Now
12094	you need a bodyguard."
12095	My cubby wasn't registered in the Hive zoning schematic as an apartment;
12096	I'd taken over a renovated warehouse loft from a friend of mine who'd
12097	run afoul of loan sharks. My friend had decided late in life to
12098	emigrate to
12099	one of the Outback colonies and I'd gotten a good deal on a place just a
12100	klick down the corridor from my office.
12101	The environment was a littl rough and sometimes the noise from the
12102	loading docks could drown out conversation, but it gave me ten times the
12103	room of a normal cubby and I could use my weights and workout equipment
12104	right at home.
12105	Johnny honestly seemed intrigued by the place and I had to kick myself
12106	for being pleased. Next thing you knew, l'd be putting on lipstick and
12107	body rouge for this cybrid.
12108	'So why do you live on Lusus?" I asked him. 'Most offworiders find the
12109	gravity a pain and the scenery monotonous. Plus your research
12110	material's at the library on Renaissance V. Why here?"
12111	I found myself looking and listening very carefully as he answered. His
12112	hair was straight on top, parted in the middle, and fell in
12113	reddish-brown curls to his collar. He had the habit of resting his
12114	cheek on his fist as he spoke.
12115	It struck me that his dialect was actually the nondialect of someone who
12116	has learned a new language perfectly but without the lazy shortcuts of
12117	someone born to it.
12118	And beneath that there was a hint of lilt that brought back the
12119	overtones of a cat burglar l'd known who had grown up on Asquith, a
12120	quiet, backwater Web world settled by First Expansion immigrants from
12121	what had once been the British Isles.
12122	'I have lived on many worlds,' he said. 'My purpose is to observe."
12123	He shook his head, winced, and gingerly touched the stitches. 'No. I'm
12124	not a poet. He ,,os."
12125	Despite the circumstances, there was an energy and vitality to Johnny
12126	that l'd found in too few men. It was hard to describe, but I'd seen
12127	rooms full of more important personages rearrange themselves to orbit
12128	around personalities like his. It was not merely his reticence and
12129	sensitivity, it was an intensity that he emanated even when merely
12130	observing.
12131	'Why doyou live here?" he asked.
12132	'I was born here."
12133	'Yes, but you spent your childhood years on Tau Ceti
12134	Center. Your father was a senator."
12135	I said nothing.
12136	'Many people expected you to go into politics,' he
12137	said. 'Did your father's suicide dissuade you?" 'It wasn't suicide,' I
12138	said.
12139	'No?"
12140	'All the news reports and the inquest said it was,' I said tonelessly,
12141	'but they were wrong. My father never would
12142	have taken his own life." 'So it was murder?" 'Yes."
12143	'Despite the fact that there was no motive or hint of a
12144	suspect?"
12145	'Yes."
12146	'I see,' said Johnny. The yellow glow from the loading dock lamps came
12147	through the dusty windows and made his hair gleam like new copper. 'Do
12148	you like being a detective?"
12149	'When I do it well,' I said. 'Are you hungry?"
12150	' No. '
12151	'Then let's get some sleep. You can have the couch." 'Do you do it well
12152	often?" he said. 'Being a detective?" 'We'll see tomorrow."
12153	In the morning Johnny farcast to Renaissance Vector at about the usual
12154	time, waited a moment in the plaza, and then 'cast to the Old Settlers'
12155	Museum on Sol Draconi Septera. From there he jumped to the main
12156	terminex on Nordholm and then 'cast to the Templar world of God's Grove.
12157	We'd worked out the timing ahead of time and I was waiting for him on
12158	Renaissance V, standing back in the shadows of the colonnade.
12159	A man with a queue was the third through after Johnny. There was no
12160	doubt he was Lusian - between the Hive pallor, the muscle and body mass,
12161	and the arrogant way of walking, he might have been my long-lost
12162	brother.
12163	He never looked at Johnny but I could tell that he was surprised when
12164	the cybrid circled around to the outbound
12165	portals. I stayed back and only caught a glimpse of his card but
12166	would've bet anything that it was a tracer.
12167	Queue was careful in the Old Settlers' Museum, keeping Johnny in sight
12168	but checking his own back as well. i was dressed in a Zen Gnostic's
12169	meditation jumper, isolation visor and all, and I never looked their way
12170	as I circled to the museum outportal and 'cast directly to God's Grove.
12171	It made me feel funny, leaving Johnny alone through the museum and
12172	Nordholm terminex, but both were public places and it was a calculated
12173	risk.
12174	Johnny came through the Worldtree arrival portal right on time and
12175	bought a ticket for the tour. His shadow had to scurry to catch up,
12176	breaking cover to board the omnibus skimmer before it left. I was
12177	already settled in the rear seat on the upper deck and Johnny found a
12178	place near the front, just as we had planned.
12179	Now I was wearing basic tourist garb and my imager was one of a dozen in
12180	action when Queue hurried to take his place three rows behind Johnny.
12181	The tour of the Worldtree is always fun - Dad first took me there when I
12182	was only three standard - but this time as the skimmer moved above
12183	branches the size of freeways and circled higher around a trunk the
12184	width of Olympus Mons, I found myself reacting to the glimpses of hooded
12185	Templars with something approaching anxiety.
12186	Johnny and I had discussed various clever and infinitely subtle ways to
12187	trail Queue if he showed up, to follow him to his lair and spend weeks
12188	if necessary deducing his game. In the end I opted for something less
12189	than the subtle approach.
12190	The omnibus had dumped us out near the Muir Museum and people were
12191	milling around on the plaza, torn between spending ten marks for a
12192	ticket to educate themselves or going straight for the gift shop, when I
12193	walked up to Queue, gripped him by the upper arm, and said in
12194	conversational tones, 'Hi. Do you mind telling me what the fuck you
12195	want with my client?"
12196	There's an old stereotype that says that Lusians are as subtle as a
12197	stomach pump and about half as pleasant. If
12198	I'd helped confirm the first part of that, Queue went a long way toward
12199	reinforcing the second prejudice.
12200	He was fast. Even with my seemingly casual grip paralyzing the muscles
12201	of his right arm, the knife in his left hand sliced up and around in
12202	less than a second.
12203	I let myself fall to my right, the knife slicing air centimeters from my
12204	cheek, hitting pavement and rolling as I palmed the neural stunner and
12205	came up on one knee to meet the threat.
12206	No threat. Queue was running. Away from me. Away from Johnny. He
12207	shoved tourists aside, dodged behind them, moving toward the museum
12208	entrance.
12209	I slid the stunner back into its wristband and began running myself.
12210	Stunners are great close-range weapons - as easy to aim as a shotgun
12211	without the dire effects if the spread pattern finds innocent bystanders
12212	- but they aren't worth anything beyond eight or ten meters.
12213	On full dispersal, I could give half the tourists in the plaza a
12214	miserable headache but Queue was already too far away to bring down. I
12215	ran after him.
12216	Johnny ran toward me. I waved him back. 'My place!' I shouted. 'Use
12217	the locks!'
12218	Queue had reached the museum entrance and now he looked back at me; the
12219	knife was still in his hand.
12220	I charged at him, feeling something like joy at the thought of the next
12221	few minutes.
12222	Queue vaulted a turnstile and shoved tourists aside to get through the
12223	doors. I followed.
12224	It was only when I reached the hushed interior of the Grand Hall and saw
12225	him shoving his way up the crowded escalator to the Excursion Mezzanine
12226	that I realized where he was headed.
12227	My father had taken me on the Templar Excursion when I was three. The
12228	farcaster portals were permanently open; it took about three hours to
12229	walk all the guided tours on the thirty worlds where the Templar
12230	ecologists had preserved some bit of nature which they thought would
12231	please the Muir. I couldn't remember for sure, but I thought the paths
12232	were loop trails with the portals relatively close together for easy
12233	transit by Templar guides and maintenance people.
12234	Shit.
12235	A uniformed guard near the tour portal saw the confusion as Queue cut
12236	through and stepped forward to intercept the rude intruder. Even from
12237	fifteen meters away I could see the shock and disbelief on the old
12238	guard's face as he staggered backward, the hilt of Queue's long knife
12239	protruding from his chest.
12240	The old guard, probably a retired local cop, looked down, face white,
12241	touched the bone hilL gingerly as if it were a gag, and collapsed face
12242	first on the mezzanine tiles. Tourists screamed. Someone yelled for a
12243	medic. I saw Queue shove a Templar guide aside and throw himself
12244	through the glowing portal.
12245	This was not going as I'd planned.
12246	I vaulted for the portal without slowing.
12247	Through and half sliding on the slippery grass of a hillside. Sky lemon
12248	yellow above us. Tropical scents. I saw startled faces turned my way.
12249	Queue was halfway to the other farcaster, cutting through elaborate
12250	flower beds and kicking aside bonsai topiary. I recognized the world of
12251	Fuji and careened down the hillside, clambering uphill again through the
12252	flower beds, following the trail of destruction Queue had left. 'Stop
12253	that man!" I screamed, realizing how foolish it sounded. No one made a
12254	move except for a Nipponese tourist who raised her imager and recorded a
12255	sequence.
12256	Queue looked back, shoved past a gawking tour group, and stepped through
12257	the farcast portal.
12258	I had the stunner in my hand again and waved it at the crowd. 'Back!
12259	Back!" They hastily made room.
12260	I went through warily, stunner raised. Queue no longer had his knife
12261	but I didn't know what other toys he carried.
12262	Brilliant light on water. The violent waves of Mare Infinitus. The
12263	path was a narrow wooden walkway ten meters above the support floats. It
12264	led out and away, curving above a fairyland coral reef and a sargasso of
12265	yellow island kelp before curving back, but a narrow catwalk cut across
12266	to the portal at the end of the trail.
12267	Queue had climbed the NO ACCESS gate and was halfway across the catwalk.
12268	I ran the ten paces to the edge of the platform, selected tightbeam, and
12269	held the stunner on full auto, sweeping the invisible beam hack and
12270	forth as if I were aiming a garden hose.
12271	Queue seemed to stumble a half step but then made the last ten meters to
12272	the portal and dived through. I cursed and climbed the gate, ignoring
12273	shouts from a Templar guide behind me. I caught a glimpse of a sign
12274	which reminded tourists to don therm gear and then I was through the
12275	portal, barely sensing the shower-tingle sensation of passing through
12276	the farcaster screen.
12277	A blizzard roared, whipping against the arched con-talnment field which
12278	turned the tourist trail into a tunnel through fierce whiteness. Sol
12279	Draconi Septem- the northern reaches where Templar lobbying of the All
12280	Thing had stopped the colonial heating project in order to save the
12281	arctic wraiths. I could feel the I.7-standard gravity on my shoulders
12282	like the yoke of my workout machine. It was a shame that Queue was a
12283	Lushan also; if he'd been Web-standard in physique, there would have
12284	been no contest if I caught him here. Now we would see who was in
12285	better shape.
12286	Queue was fifty meters down the trail and looking back over his
12287	shoulder. The other farcaster was somewhere near but the blizzard made
12288	anything off the trail invisible and inaccessible. I began loping after
12289	him. In deference to the gravity, this was the shortest of the Templar
12290	Excursion trails, curving back after only two hundred or so meters. I
12291	could hear Queue's panting as I closed on him. I was running easily;
12292	there was no way that he was going to beat me to the next farcaster. I
12293	saw no tourists on the trail and so far no one had given chase.
12294	I thought that this would not be a bad place to interrogate him.
12295	Queue was thirty meters short of the exit portal when he turned, dropped
12296	to one knee, and aimed an energy pistol. The first bolt was short,
12297	possibly because of the unaccustomed weight of the weapon in Sol
12298	Draconi's gravity field, but it was close enough to leave a scorched
12299	slash of slagged walkway and melted permafrost to within a meter of me.
12300	He adjusted his aim.
12301	I went out through the containment field, shouldering my way through the
12302	elastic resistance and stumbling into drifts above my waist. The cold
12303	air burned my lungs and wind-driven snow caked my face and bare arms in
12304	seconds.
12305	I could see Queue looking for me from within the lighted pathway, but
12306	the blizzard dimness worked in my favor now as I threw myself through
12307	drifts in his direction.
12308	Queue forced his head, shoulders, and right arm through the field wall,
12309	squinting in the barrage of icy particles which coated his cheeks and
12310	brow in an instant.
12311	His second shot was high and I felt the heat of the bolt as it passed
12312	over. I was within ten meters of him now; I set the stunner on widest
12313	dispersal and sprayed it in his direction without lifting my head from
12314	the snowdrift where I had dropped.
12315	Queue let the energy pistol tumble into the snow and fell back through
12316	the containment field.
12317	I screamed in triumph, my shout lost in the wind roar, and staggered
12318	toward the field wall. My hands and feet were distant things now,
12319	beyond the pain of cold. My cheeks and ears burned. I put the thought
12320	of frostbite out of my mind and threw myself against the field.
12321	It was a class-three field, designed to keep out the elements and
12322	anything as huge as an arctic wraith, while allowing the occasional
12323	errant tourist or errand-bent Templar reentry to the path, but in my
12324	cold-weakened condition I found myself batting against it for a moment
12325	like a fly against plastic, my feet slipping on snow and ice. Finally I
12326	threw myself forward, landing heavily and clumsily, dragging my legs
12327	through.
12328	The sudden warmth of the pathway set me to shaking uncontrollably.
12329	Shards of sleet fell from me as I forced myself to my knees, then to my
12330	feet.
12331	Queue ran the last five yards to the exit portal with his right arm
12332	dangling as if broken. I knew the nerve-fire agony of a neural stunner
12333	and did not envy him. He looked back once as I began running toward him
12334	and then he went through.
12335	Maui-Covenant. The air was tropical and smelled of ocean and
12336	vegetation. The sky was an Old Earth blue. I saw immediately that the
12337	trail had led to one of the few free motile isles which the Templars had
12338	saved from Hegemony domestication. It was a large isle, perhaps half a
12339	kilometer from end to end, and from the access portal's vantage point on
12340	a wide deck encircling the main treesail trunk I could see the expansive
12341	sail leaves filling with wind and the indigo rudder vines trailing far
12342	behind.
12343	The exit portal lay only fifteen meters away down a staircase but I saw
12344	at once that Queue had run the other way, along the main trail, toward a
12345	cluster of huts and concession stands near the edge of the isle.
12346	It was only here, halfway along the Templar Excursion trail, that they
12347	allowed human structures to shelter weary hikers while they purchased
12348	refreshments or souvenirs to benefit the Templar Brotherhood. I began
12349	jogging down the wide staircase to the trail below, still shivering, my
12350	clothes soaked with rapidly melting snow.
12351	Why was Queue running toward the cluster of people there?
12352	I saw the bright carpets laid out for rental and understood.
12353	The hawking mats were illegal on most Web worlds but still a tradition
12354	on Maui-Covenant because of the Siri legend; less than two meters long
12355	and a meter wide, the ancient playthings lay waiting to carry tourists
12356	out over the sea and back again to the wandering isle. If Queue reached
12357	one of those... I broke into a full sprint, catching the other Lusian a
12358	few meters short of the hawking mat area and tackling him just below the
12359	knees.
12360	We rolled into the concession stand area and the few tourists there
12361	shouted and scattered.
12362	My father taught me one thing which any child ignores at his or her own
12363	peril: a good big guy can always beat a good little guy. In this case
12364	we were about even. Queue twisted free and jumped to his feet, falling
12365	into an arms-out, fingers-splayed oriental fighting stance. Now we'd
12366	see who the better guy was.
12367	Queue got the first blow in, feinting a straight-fingered jab with his
12368	left hand and coming up and around with a swinging kick instead. I
12369	ducked but he connected solidly enough to make my left shoulder and
12370	upper arm go numb.
12371	Queue danced backward. I followed. He swung a close-fisted
12372	right-handed punch. I blocked it. He chopped with his left hand. I
12373	blocked with my right forearm.
12374	Queue danced back, whirled, and unleashed a left-footed kick. I ducked,
12375	caught his leg as it passed over, and dumped him on the sand.
12376	Queue jumped up. I knocked him down with a short left hook. He rolled
12377	away and scrambled to his knees. I kicked him behind his left ear,
12378	pulling the blow enough to leave him conscious.
12379	Too conscious, I realized a second later as he ran four fingers under my
12380	guard in an attempted heart jab.
12381	Instead, he bruised the layers of muscle under my right breast. I
12382	punched him full force in the mouth, sending blood spraying as he rolled
12383	to the waterline and lay still.
12384	Behind us, people ran toward the exit portal, calling to the few others
12385	to get the police.
12386	I lifted Johnny's would-be assassin by his queue, dragged him to the
12387	edge of the isle, and dipped his face in the water until he came to.
12388	Then I rolled him over and lifted him by his torn and stained
12389	shirtfront. We would have only a minute or two until someone arrived.
12390	Queue stared up at me with a glazed glare. I shook him once and leaned
12391	close. 'Listen, my friend,' I whispered.
12392	'We're going to have a short but sincere conversation.
12393	We'll start with who you are and why you're bothering the guy you were
12394	following."
12395	I felt the surge of current before I saw the blue. I cursed and let go
12396	of his shirtfront. The electrical nimbus seemed to surround Queue's
12397	entire body at once. I jumped back but not before my own hair stood on
12398	end and surge control alarms on my comlog chirped urgently. Queue
12399	opened his mouth to scream and I could see the blue within like a poorly
12400	done holo special effect.
12401	His shirtfront sizzled, blackened, and burst into flame.
12402	Beneath it his chest grew blue spots like an ancient film burning
12403	through. The spots widened, joined, widened again. I looked into his
12404	chest cavity and saw organs melting in blue flame. He screamed again,
12405	audibly this time, and I watched as teeth and eyes collapsed into blue
12406	fire.
12407	I took another step back.
12408	Queue was burning now, the orange-red flames superseding the blue glow.
12409	His flesh exploded outward with flame as if his bones had ignited.
12410	Within a minute he was a smoking caricature of charred flesh, the body
12411	reduced to the ancient dwarf-boxer posture of burning victims
12412	everywhere. I turned away and put a hand over my mouth, searching the
12413	faces of the few watchers to see if any of them could have done this.
12414	Wide, frightened eyes stared back. Far above, gray security uniforms
12415	burst from the farcaster.
12416	Damn. I looked around. The treesails surged and bil-lowed overhead.
12417	Radiant gossamers, beautiful even in daylight, flitted among tropical
12418	vegetation of a hundred hues. Sunlight danced on blue ocean. The way
12419	to both portals was blocked. The security guard leading the group had
12420	drawn a weapon.
12421	I was to the first hawking mat in three strides, trying to remember from
12422	my own ride two decades earlier how the flight threads were activated. I
12423	tapped designs in desperation.
12424	The hawking mat went rigid and lifted ten centimeters off the beach. I
12425	could hear the shouts now as security guards reached the edge of the
12426	crowd. A woman in gaudy Renaissance Minor garb pointed my way. I
12427	jumped off the hawking mat, gathered up the other seven mats, and jumped
12428	aboard my own. Barely able to find the flight designs under the tumble
12429	of rugs, I slapped the forward controls until the mat lurched into
12430	flight, almost tumbling me off as it rose.
12431	Fifty meters out, thirty meters high, I dumped the other mats into the
12432	sea and swiveled to see what was happening on the beach. Several gray
12433	uniforms were huddled around the burned remains. Another pointed a
12434	silver wand in my direction.
12435	Delicate needles of pain tingled along my arm, shoulders, and neck. My
12436	eyelids drooped and I almost slid off the mat to my right. I gripped
12437	the far side with my left hand, slumped forward, and tapped at the
12438	ascent design with fingers made of wood. Climbing again, I fumbled at
12439	my right sleeve for my own stunner. The wristband was empty.
12440	A minute later I sat up and shook off most of the effects of the stun,
12441	although my fingers still burned and I had a fierce headache. The
12442	motile isle was far behind, shrinking more each second. A century ago
12443	the island would have been driven by the bands of dolphins brought here
12444	originally during the Hegira, but the Hegemony pacification program
12445	during the Siri Rebellion had killed off most of the aquatic mammals and
12446	now the islands wandered listlessly, carrying their cargo of Web
12447	tourists and resort owners·
12448	I checked the horizons for another island, a hint of one of the rare
12449	mainlands. Nothing. Or, rather, blue sky, endless. ocean, and soft
12450	brushstrokes of clouds far to the west. Or was it to the east?
12451	I pulled my comiog off my belt lock and keyed in general datasphere
12452	access, then stopped. If the authorities had chased me this far, the
12453	next step would be to pinpoint my location and send out a skimmer or
12454	security EMV. I wasn't sure if they could trace my comlog when I logged
12455	in but I saw no reason to help them. I thumbed the comm-link on standby
12456	and looked around again.
12457	Good move, Brawne. Poking along at two hundred meters on a
12458	three-century-old hawking mat with who knows how many... or how few!...
12459	hours of charge in its flight threads, possibly a thousand klicks or
12460	more from land of any sort. And lost. Great. I crossed my arms and
12461	sat back to think.
12462	'M. Lamia?" Johnny's soft voice almost made me jump off the mat.
12463	'Johnny?" I stared at the cornlog. It was still on standby. The
12464	general comm frequency indicator was dark. 'Johnny, is that you?"
12465	'Of course. I thought you'd never turn your comlog on."
12466	'How did you trace me? What band are you calling o!i?"
12467	'Never mind that. Where are you headed?"
12468	I laughed and told him that I didn't have the slightest idea. 'Can you
12469	help?"
12470	'Wait." There was the briefest second of pause. 'All
12471	right, I have you on one of the weather-mapping sats. A terribly
12472	primitive thing. Good thing your hawking mat has a passive
12473	transponder."
12474	I stared at the rug that was the only thing between me and a long, loud
12475	fall to the sea. 'It does? Can the others track me?"
12476	'They could,' said Johnny, 'but I'm jamming this par ticular signal.
12477	Now, where do you want to go?" 'Home."
12478	'I'm not sure if that's wise after the death of... ah · . . our
12479	suspect."
12480	I squinted, suddenly suspicious. 'How do you know about that? I didn't
12481	say anything."
12482	'Be serious, M. Lamia. The security bands are full of it on six
12483	worlds. They have a reasonable description of you. '
12484	'Shit."
12485	'Precisely. Now where would you like to go?" 'Where are you?" I asked.
12486	'My place?"
12487	'No. I left there when the security bands mentioned you. I'm... near
12488	a farcaster."
12489	'That's where I need to be." I looked around again.
12490	Ocean sky, a hint of clouds. At least no fleets of EMVs.
12491	'All right,' said Johnny's disembodied voice. 'There's a powered-down
12492	FORCE multi-portal less than ten klicks from your present location."
12493	I shielded my eyes and rotated three hundred and sixty degrees. 'The
12494	hell there is,' I said. 'I don't know how far away the horizon is on
12495	this world, but it's at least forty klicks and I can't see anything."
12496	'Submersible base,' said Johnny. 'Hang on. l'm going to take control."
12497	The hawking mat lurched again, dipped once, and then fell steadily. I
12498	held on with both hands and resisted the urge to scream.
12499	'Submersible,' I called against the wind rush, 'how far?"
12500	'Do you mean how deep?"
12501	'Yeah!'
12502	'Eight fathoms."
12503	I converted the archaic units to meters. This time I did
12504	scream. 'That's almost fourteen meters underwater!' 'Where else do you
12505	expect a submersible to be?"
12506	'What the hell do you expect me to do, hold my breath?" The ocean rushed
12507	toward me.
12508	'Not necessary,' said my comlog. 'The hawking mat has a primitive crash
12509	field. It should easily hold for a mere eight fathoms. Please hang
12510	on."
12511	I hung on.
12512	Johnny was waiting for me when I arrived. The submersible had been dark
12513	and dank with the sweat of abandonment; the farcaster had been of a
12514	military variety l'd never seen before. It was a relief to step into
12515	sunlight and a city street with Johnny waiting.
12516	I told him what had happened to Queue. We walked empty streets past old
12517	buildings. The sky was pale blue fading toward evening. No one was in
12518	sight. 'Hey,' I said, stopping, 'where are we?" It was an incredibly
12519	Earthlike world but the sky, the gravity, the texture of the place was
12520	like nothing I'd visited.
12521	Johnny smiled. 'I'II let you guess. Let's walk some more."
12522	There were ruins to our left as we walked down a wide street. I stopped
12523	and stared. 'That's the Colosseum,' I said. 'The Roman Colosseum on
12524	Old Earth." I looked around at the aging buildings, the cobblestone
12525	streets, and the trees swaying slightly in a soft breeze. 'This is a
12526	reconstruction of the Old Earth city of Rome,' I said, trying to keep
12527	the astonishment out of my voice. 'New Earth?" I knew at once that it
12528	wasn't. I'd been to New Earth numerous times and the sky tones, smells,
12529	and gravity had not been like this.
12530	Johnny shook his head. 'This is nowhere in the Web." I stopped walking.
12531	'That's impossible." By definition, any world which could be reached by
12532	farcaster was in the Web.
12533	'Nonetheless, it is not in the Web." 'Where is it then?" 'Old Earth."
12534	We walked on. Johnny pointed out another ruin. 'The Forum." Descending
12535	a long staircase, he said, 'Ahead is the Piazza di Spagna where we'll
12536	spend the night."
12537	'Old Earth,' I said, my first comment in twenty minutes.
12538	'Time travel?"
12539	'That is not possible, M. Lamia."
12540	'A theme park then?"
12541	Johnny laughed. It was a pleasant laugh, unself-conscious and easy.
12542	'Perhaps. I don't really know its purpose or function. It is... an
12543	analog."
12544	'An analog." I squinted at the red, setting sun just visible down a
12545	narrow street. 'It looks like the holos I've seen of Old Earth. It
12546	feels right, even though l've never been there."
12547	'It is very accurate."
12548	'Where is it? I mean, what star?"
12549	'I don't know the number,' said Johnny. 'It's in the Hercules Cluster."
12550	I managed not to repeat what he said but I stopped and sat down on one
12551	of the steps. With the Hawking drive humankind had explored, colonized,
12552	and linked with farcaster worlds across many thousands of light-years.
12553	But no one had tried to reach the exploding Core suns.
12554	We had barely crawled out of the cradle of one spiral arm. The Hercules
12555	Cluster.
12556	'Why has the TechnoCore built a replica of Rome in the Hercules
12557	Cluster?" I asked.
12558	Johnny sat next to me. We both looked up as a whirling mass of pigeons
12559	exploded into flight and wheeled above the rooftops. 'I don't know, M.
12560	Lamia.
12561	There is much that I have not learned ... at least partially because I
12562	have not been interested until now. '
12563	'Brawne,' I said.
12564	'Excuse me?" 'Call me Brawne."
12565	Johnny smiled and inclined his head. 'Thank you, Brawne. One thing,
12566	though. I do not believe that it is a replica of the city of Rome
12567	alone. It is all of Old Earth."
12568	l set both hands on the sun-warmed stone of the step I was sitting on.
12569	'All of Old Earth? All of its... continents, cities?"
12570	'l believe so. I haven't been out of ltaly and England
12571	except for a sea voyage between the two, but I believe the analog is
12572	complete."
12573	'Why, for God's sake?"
12574	Johnny nodded slowly. 'That may indeed be the case.
12575	Why don't we go inside and eat and talk more about this? It may relate
12576	to who tried to kill me and why."
12577	'Inside' was an apartment in a large house at the foot of the marble
12578	stairs. Windows looked out on what Johnny called the 'piazza' and I
12579	could see up the staircase to a large, yellow-brown church above, and
12580	down to the square where a boat-shaped fountain tossed water into the
12581	evening stillness. Johnny said that the fountain had been designed by
12582	Bernini but the name meant nothing to me.
12583	The rooms were small but high-ceilinged, with rough but elaborately
12584	carved furniture from an era I did not recognize. There was no sign of
12585	electricity or modern appliances. The house did not respond when I
12586	spoke to it at the door and again in the apartment upstairs. As dusk
12587	fell over the square and city outside the tall windows, the only lights
12588	were a few streetlamps of gas or some more primitive combustible.
12589	'This is out of Old Earth's past,' I said, touching the thick pillows. I
12590	raised my head, suddenly understanding.
12591	'Keats died in Italy. Early... nineteenth or twentieth century. This
12592	is... then."
12593	'Yes. Early nineteenth century: I82I, to be precise." 'The whole world
12594	is a museum?"
12595	'Oh no. Different areas are different eras, of course. It depends upon
12596	the analog being pursued."
12597	'I don't understand." We had moved into a room cluttered with thick
12598	furniture and I sat on an oddly carved couch by a window. A film of
12599	gold evening light still touched the spire of the tawny church up the
12600	steps.
12601	Pigeons wheeled white against blue sky. 'Are there millions of
12602	people... cybrids... living on this fake Old Earth?"
12603	'I do not believe so,' said Johnny. 'Only the number necessary for the
12604	particular analog project." He saw that ! still did not understand and
12605	took a breath before continuing. 'When I... awoke here, there were
12606	cybrid analogs of Joseph Severn, Dr Clark, the landlady Anna Angeletti,
12607	young Lieutenant Elton, and a few others.
12608	Italian shopkeepers, the owner of the trattoria across the square who
12609	used to bring us our food, passersby, that
12610	sort of thing. No more than a score at the most." 'What happened to
12611	them?"
12612	'They were probably... recycled. Like the man with the queue."
12613	'Queue..." I suddenly stared across the darkening room at Johnny. 'He
12614	was a cybrid?"
12615	'Without doubt. The self-destruction you described is precisely the way
12616	I would rid myself of this cybrid if I had tO."
12617	My mind was racing. I realized how stupid I had been, how little I had
12618	learned about anything. 'Then it was
12619	another AI who tried to kill you." 'It seems that way." 'Why?"
12620	Johnny made a gesture with his hands. 'Possibly to erase some quantum
12621	of knowledge that died with my cybrid. Something I had learned only
12622	recently and the other AI ... or Als knew would be destroyed in my
12623	systems crash."
12624	I stood, paced back and forth, and stopped at the window. The darkness
12625	was settling in earnest now. There were lamps in the room but Johnny
12626	made no move to light them and I preferred the dimness. It made the
12627	unreality of what I was hearing even that much more unreal. I looked
12628	into the bedroom. The western windows admitted the last of the light;
12629	bedclothes glowed whitely.
12630	'You died here,' I said.
12631	'He did,' said Johnny. 'I am not he." 'But you have his memories."
12632	'Half-forgotten dreams. There are gaps." 'But you know what he felt."
12633	'I remember what the designers thought that he felt." 'Tell me."
12634	'What?" Johnny's skin was very pale in the gloom. His short curls
12635	looked black.
12636	'What it was like to die. What it was like to be reborn."
12637	Johnny told me, his voice very soft, almost melodic, lapsing sometimes
12638	into an English too archaic to be understood but far more beautiful to
12639	the ear than the hybrid tongue we speak today.
12640	He told me what it was like to be a poet obsessed with perfection, far
12641	harsher toward his own efforts than even the most vicious critic. And
12642	the critics were vicious. His work was dismissed, ridiculed, described
12643	as derivative and silly. Too poor to marry the woman he loved, loaning
12644	money to his brother in America and thus losing the last chance of
12645	financial security... and then the brief glory of growing into the full
12646	maturation of his poetic powers just as he fell prey to the
12647	'consumption' which had claimed his mother and his brother Tom. Then
12648	sent off to exile in Italy, reputedly 'for his health' while knowing all
12649	the while it meant a lonely, painful death at the age of twenty-six. He
12650	talked of the agony of seeing Fanny's handwriting on the letters he
12651	found too painful to open; he talked of the loyalty of the young artist
12652	Joseph Severn, who had been chosen as a traveling companion for Keats by
12653	'friends' who had abandoned the poet at the end, of how Severn had
12654	nursed the dying man and stayed with him during the final days. He told
12655	of the hemorrhages in the night, of Dr Clark bleeding him and
12656	prescribing 'exercise and good air,' and of the ultimate religious and
12657	personal despair which had led Keats to demand his own epitaph be carved
12658	in stone as: 'Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water."
12659	Only the dimmest light from below outlined the tall windows. Johnny's
12660	voice seemed to fioat in the night-scented air. He spoke of awakening
12661	after his death in the bed where he died, still attended by the loyal
12662	Severn and Dr Clark, of remembering that he was the poet John Keats the
12663	way one remembers an identity from a fast-fading dream while all the
12664	while knowing that he was something else.
12665	He told of the illusion continued, the trip back to England, the reunion
12666	with the Fanny-who-was-not-Fanny and the near mental breakdown this had
12667	engendered.
12668	He told of his inability to write further poetry, of his increasing
12669	estrangement from the cybrid impostors,
12670	of his retreat into something resembling catatonia combined with
12671	'hallucinations' of his true AI existence in the nearly incomprehensible
12672	(to a nineteenth-century poet) TechnoCore, and of the ultimate crumbling
12673	of the illusion and the abandonment of the 'Keats Project."
12674	'In truth,' he said, 'the entire, evil charade made me think of nothing
12675	so much as a passage in a letter I wrote · . . he wrote... to his
12676	brother George some time before his illness. Keats said:
12677	'May there not be superior beings amused with any graceful, though
12678	instinctive attitude my mind may fall into, as I am entertained with the
12679	alertness of a Stoat or the anxiety of a Deer? Though a quarrel in the
12680	streets is a thing to be hated, the energies dis· played in it are fine.
12681	By a superior being our reasonings may take the same tone - though
12682	erroneous they may be fine - This is the very thing in which consists
12683	poetry."
12684	'You think the . . . Keats Project . . . was evil?" I asked.
12685	'Anything which deceives is evil, I believe."
12686	'Perhaps you are more John Keats than you are willing to admit."
12687	'No. The absence of poetic instinct showed otherwise even in the midst
12688	of the most elaborate illusion."
12689	I looked at the dark outlines of shapes in the dark house. 'Do the AIs
12690	know that we're here?"
12691	'Probably. Almost surely. There is no place that I can go that the
12692	TechnoCore cannot trace and follow. But it was the Web authorities and
12693	brigands from whom we fled, no?"
12694	'But you know now that it was someone . . . some intelligence in the
12695	TechnoCore who assaulted you."
12696	'Yes, but only in the Web. Such violence in the Core would not be
12697	tolerated."
12698	There came a noise from the street. A pigeon, I hoped.
12699	Wind blowing trash across cobblestones perhaps. I said, 'How will the
12700	TechnoCore respond to my being here?"
12701	'I have no idea."
12702	'Surely it must be a secret."
12703	'It is ... something they consider irrelevant to humanity."
12704	I shook my head, a futile gesture in the darkness. 'The re-creation of
12705	Old Earth... the resurrection of... how many? ... human
12706	personalities as cybrids on this re-created world... AIs killing Als...
12707	irrelevant!" I laughed but managed to keep the laughter under control.
12708	'Jesus wept, Johnny."
12709	'Almost certainly."
12710	I moved to the window, not caring what sort of target l would afford
12711	anyone in t he dark street below, and fumbled out a cigarette. They
12712	were damp from the afteruoon's chase through the snowdrifts but one
12713	lighted when I struck it. 'Johnny, earlier when you said that the Old
12714	Earth analog was complete, I said,"Why, for God's sake?" and you said
12715	something like "That may be the case." Was that
12716	just a wiseass comment or did you mean something?" 'I mean that it might
12717	indeed be for God's sake." 'Explain."
12718	Johnny sighed in the darkness. 'I don't understand the exact purpose of
12719	the Keats Project or the other Old Earth analogs, but I suspect that it
12720	is part of a TechnoCore project going back at least seven standard
12721	centuries to realize the Ultimate Intelligence."
12722	'The Ultimate Intelligence,' I said, exhaling smoke.
12723	'Uh-huh. So theTechnoCore is trying to... what?... to
12724	build God." 'Yes,' 'Why?"
12725	'There is no simple answer, Brawne. Any more than there is a simple
12726	answer to the question of why humankind has sought God in a million
12727	guises for ten thousand generations.
12728	But with the Core, the interest lies more in the quest for more
12729	efficiency, more reliable ways to handle...
12730	variables."
12731	'But the TechnoCore can draw on itself and the mega-datasphere of two
12732	hundred worlds."
12733	'And there still will be blanks in the . . . predictive powers."
12734	I threw my cigarette out the window, watching the ember fall into the
12735	night. The breeze was suddenly cold; I hugged my arms. 'How does all
12736	this... Old Earth, the resurrection projects, the cybrids... how does
12737	it lead to creating the Ultimate Intelligence?"
12738	'I don't know, Brawne. Eight standard centuries ago, at the beginning
12739	of the First Information Age, a man named Norbert Wiener wrote: "Can God
12740	play a significant game with his own creature? Can any creator, even a
12741	limited one, play a significant game with his own creature?"
12742	Humanity dealt with this inconclusively with their early Als. The Core
12743	wrestles with it in the resurrection projects. Perhaps the UI program
12744	has been completed and all of this remains a function of the ultimate
12745	Creature/Creator, a personality whose motives are as far beyond the
12746	Core's understanding as the Core's are beyond humanity's."
12747	I started to move in the dark room, bumped a low table with my knee, and
12748	remained standing. 'None of which tells us who is trying to kill you,'
12749	I said.
12750	'No." Johnny rose and moved to the far wall. A match flared and he
12751	lighted a candle. Our shadows wavered on the walls and ceiling.
12752	Johnny came closer and softly gripped my upper arms. The soft light
12753	painted his curls and eyelashes copper and touched his high cheekbones
12754	and firm chin.
12755	'Why are you so tough?" he asked.
12756	I stared at him. His face was only inches from mine.
12757	We were the same height. 'Let go,' I said.
12758	Instead, he leaned forward and kissed me. His lips were soft and warm
12759	and the kiss seemed to last for hours.
12760	He's a machine, I thought. Human, but a machine behind that. I closed
12761	my eyes. His soft hand touched my cheek, my neck, the back of my head.
12762	'Listen..." I whispered when we broke apart for an instant.
12763	Johnny did not let me finish. He lifted me in his arms and carried me
12764	into the other room. The tall bed. The soft mattress and deep
12765	comforter. The candlelight from the other room flickered and danced as
12766	we undressed each other in a sudden urgency.
12767	We made love three times that night, each time responding to slow, sweet
12768	imperatives of touch and warmth and closeness and the escalating
12769	intensity of sensation.
12770	I remember looking down at him the second time; his eyes were closed,
12771	hair fell loosely across his forehead, the candlelight showing the flush
12772	across his pale chest, his surprisingly strong arms and hands rising to
12773	hold me in place. He had opened his eyes that second to look back at me
12774	and I saw only the emotion and passion of that moment reflected there.
12775	Sometime before dawn we slept; just as I turned away and drifted off, I
12776	felt the cool touch of his hand on my hip in a movement protective and
12777	casual without being possessive.
12778	They hit us just after first light. There were five of them, not Lusian
12779	but heavily muscled, all men, and they worked well together as a team.
12780	The first I heard of them was when the door to the apartment was kicked
12781	open. I rolled out of bed, jumped to the side of the bedroom door, and
12782	watched them come through. Johnny sat up and shouted something as the
12783	first man leveled a stunner. Johnny had pulled on cotton shorts before
12784	going to sleep; I was nude. There are real disadvantages to fighting in
12785	the nude when one's opponents are dressed, but the greatest problem is
12786	psychological.
12787	If you can get over the sense of heightened vulnerability, the rest is
12788	easy to compensate for.
12789	The first man saw me, decided to stun Johnny anyway, and paid for the
12790	mistake. I kicked the weapon out of his hand and clubbed him down with
12791	a blow behind the left ear. Two more men pushed into the room. This
12792	time both of them were smart enough to deal with me first. Two others
12793	leaped for Johnny.
12794	I blocked a stiff-fingered jab, parried a kick that would have done real
12795	damage, and backed away. There was a tall dresser to my left and the
12796	top drawer came out smooth and heavy. The big man in front of me
12797	shielded his face with both arms so that the thick wood splintered, but
12798	the instinctive reaction gave me a second's opening and I took it,
12799	putting my entire body into the kick.
12800	Number two man grunted and fell back against his partner.
12801	Johnny was struggling but one of the intruders had him around the throat
12802	in a choke hold while the other pinned his legs. I came off the floor
12803	in a crouch, accepted the blow from my number two, and leaped across the
12804	bed. The guy holding Johnny's legs went through the glass and wood of
12805	the window without a word.
12806	Someone landed on my back and I completed the roll across the bed and
12807	floor, bringing him up against the wall. He was good. He took the blow
12808	on his shoulder and went for a nerve pinch beneath my ear. He had a
12809	second of trouble because of the extra layers of muscle there and I got
12810	an elbow deep into his stomach and rolled away.
12811	The man choking Johnny dropped him and delivered a text-book-perfect
12812	kick to my ribs. I took half the impact, feeling at least one rib go,
12813	and spun inside, attempting no elegance as I used my left hand to crush
12814	his left testicle.
12815	The man screamed and was out of it.
12816	I'd never forgotten the stunner on the floor and neither had the last of
12817	the opposition. He scurried around to the far side of the bed, out of
12818	reach, and dropped to all fours to grab the weapon. Definitely feeling
12819	the pain from the broken rib now, I lifted the massive bed with Johnny
12820	in it and dropped it on the guy's head and shoulders.
12821	I went under the bed from my side, retrieved the stunner, and backed
12822	into an empty corner.
12823	One guy had gone out the window. We were on the second floor. The
12824	first man to enter was still lying in the doorway. The guy I'd kicked
12825	had managed to get to one knee and both elbows. From the blood on his
12826	mouth and chin, I guessed that a rib had punctured a lung. He was
12827	breathing very raggedly. The bed had crushed the skull of the other man
12828	on the floor. The guy who'd been choking Johnny was curled up near the
12829	window, holding his crotch and vomiting. I stunned him into silence and
12830	went over to the one I'd kicked and lifted him by the hair.
12831	'Who sent you?"
12832	'Fuck you." He sprayed some bloody spittle in my face.
12833	'Maybe later,' I said· 'Again, who sent you?" I placed three fingers
12834	against his side where the ribcage seemed concave and pressed.
12835	The man screamed and went very white. When he coughed the blood was too
12836	red against pale skin.
12837	'Who sent you?" I set four fingers against his ribs.
12838	'The bishop!" He tried to levitate away from my fingers.
12839	'What bishop?"
12840	'Shrike Temple... Lusus... don't, please... oh, shit..."
12841	'What were you going to do with him... us?"
12842	'Nothing ... Oh, God damn . . . don't! I need a medic, please!'
12843	'Sure. Answer."
12844	'Stun him, bring him . . . back to the Temple . . .
12845	Lusus. Please. I can't breathe."
12846	'And me?"
12847	'Kill you if you resisted."
12848	'Okay,' I said, lifting him a little higher by his hair, 'we're doing
12849	fine here. What did they want him for?"
12850	'I don't know." He screamed very loudly. I kept one eye on the doorway
12851	to the apartment. The stunner .was still in my palm under a fistful of
12852	hair. 'I... don't...
12853	know..." he gasped. He was hemorrhaging in earnest
12854	now. The blood dripped on my arm and left breast.
12855	'How'd you get here?" 'EMV... roof." 'Where'd you 'cast in?"
12856	'Don't know... I swear... some city in the water.
12857	Cat's set to return there... please!'
12858	I ripped at his clothes. No comlog. No other weapons.
12859	There was a tattoo of a blue trident just above his heart.
12860	'Goonda?" I said.
12861	'Yeah... Parvati Brotherhood."
12862	Outside the Web. Probably very hard to trace. 'All of you?"
12863	'Yeah... please... get me some help... oh, shit ·.. please..." He
12864	sagged, almost unconscious.
12865	I dropped him, stepped back, and sprayed the stun beam over him.
12866	Johnny was sitting up, rubbing his throat, and staring at me with a
12867	strange gaze.
12868	'Get dressed,' I said. 'We're leaving."
12869	The EMV was an old, transparent Vikken Scenic with no palmlocks on the
12870	ignition plate or diskey. We caught up to the terminator before we had
12871	crossed France and looked down on darkness that Johnny said was the
12872	Atlantic Ocean. Except for lights of the occasional floating city or
12873	drilling platform, the only illumination came from the stars and the
12874	broad, swimming-pool glows of the undersea colonies.
12875	'Why are we taking their vehicle?" asked Johnny.
12876	'I want to see where they farcast from." :He said the Lusus Shrike
12877	Temple." 'Yeah. Now we'll see."
12878	Johnny's face was barely visible as he looked down at the dark sea
12879	twenty klicks below. 'Do you think those men will die?"
12880	'One was already dead,' I said. 'The guy with the punctured lung will
12881	need help. Two of them'll be okay. I don't know about the one who went
12882	out the window. Do you care?"
12883	'Yes. The violence was... barbaric."
12884	' "Though a quarrel in the street is a thing to be hated, the energies
12885	displayed in it are fine," ' I quoted. 'They
12886	weren't cybrids, were they?"
12887	'I think not."
12888	'So there are at least two groups out to get you the Als and the bishop
12889	of the Shrike Temple. And we still don't know why."
12890	'I do have an idea now."
12891	I swiveled in the foam reelinet. The constellations above us - familiar
12892	neither from holos of Old Earth's skies nor from any Web world I knew -
12893	cast just enough light to allow me to see Johnny's eyes. 'Tell me,' I
12894	said.
12895	'Your mention of Hyperion gave me a clue,' he said.
12896	'The fact that I had no knowledge of it. Its absence said that it was
12897	important."
12898	'The strange case of the dog barking in the night,' l said.
12899	'What?"
12900	'Nothing. Go on."
12901	Johnny leaned closer· 'The only reason that I would not be aware of it
12902	is that some elements of the Techno-Core have blocked my knowledge of
12903	it."
12904	'Your cybrid..." It was strange to talk to Johnny that way now. 'You
12905	spend most of your time in the Web,
12906	don't you?"
12907	'Yes."
12908	'Wouldn't you run across mention of Hyperion somewhere?
12909	It's in the news every once in a while, especially when the Shrike
12910	Cult's topical."
12911	'Perhaps I did hear. Perhaps that is why I was murdered."
12912	I lay back and looked at the stars. 'Let's go ask the bishop,' I said.
12913	Johnny said that the lights ahead were an analog of New York City in the
12914	mid-twenty-first century. He didn't know what resurrection project the
12915	city had been rebuilt for. I took the EMV off auto and dropped lower.
12916	Tall buildings from the phallic-symbol era of urban architecture rose
12917	from the swamps and lagoons of the North American littoral. Several had
12918	lights burning.
12919	Johnny pointed to one decrepit but oddly elegant structure and said,
12920	'The Empire State Building."
12921	'Okay,' I said. 'Whatever it is, that's where the EMV
12922	wants to land."
12923	'Is it safe?"
12924	I grinned at him. 'Nothing in life's safe." I let the car have its head
12925	and we dropped to a small, open platform below the building's spire. We
12926	got out and stood on the cracked balcony. It was quite dark except for
12927	the few building lights far below and the stars. A few paces away, a
12928	vague blue glow outlined a farcaster portal where elevator doors may
12929	once have been.
12930	'I'II go first,' I said but Johnny had already stepped through. I
12931	palmed the borrowed stunner and followed him.
12932	I'd never been in the Shrike Temple on Lusus before but there was no
12933	doubt that we were there now. Johnny stood a few paces ahead of me but
12934	other than him there was no one around· The place was cool and dark and
12935	cavernous if caverns could really be that large. A frightening
12936	polychrome sculpture which hung from invisible cables rotated to unfelt
12937	breezes. Johnny and I both turned as the farcaster portal winked out of
12938	existence.
12939	'Well, we did their work for them, didn't we?" I whispered to Johnny.
12940	Even the whisper seemed to echo in the red-lit hall. I hadn't planned
12941	on Johnny 'casting to the Temple with me.
12942	The light seemed to come up then, not really illuminating the great hall
12943	but widening its scope so that we could see the semicircle of men there.
12944	I remembered that some were called exorcists and others lectors and
12945	there was some other category I forgot. Whoever they were, it was
12946	alarming to see them standing there, at least two dozen of them, their
12947	robes variations on red and black and their high foreheads glowing from
12948	the red light above. I had no trouble recognizing the bishop. He was
12949	from my world, although shorter and fatter than most of us, and his robe
12950	was very red.
12951	I did not try to hide the stunner. It was possible that if they all
12952	tried to rush us I could bring them all down.
12953	Possible but not probable. I could not see any weapons but their robes
12954	could have hidden entire arsenals.
12955	Johnny walked toward the bishop and I followed. Ten paces from the man
12956	we stopped. The bishop was the only one not standing. His chair was
12957	made of wood and looked as if it could be folded so that the intricate
12958	arms, supports, back, and legs could be carried in a compact form. One
12959	couldn't say the same of the mass of muscle and fat evident under the
12960	bishop's robes.
12961	Johnny took another step forward. 'Why did you try to kidnap my
12962	cybrid?" He spoke to the Shrike Cult holy man as if the rest of us were
12963	not there.
12964	The bishop chuckled and shook his head. 'My dear · . . entity... it
12965	is true that we wished your presence in our place of worship, but you
12966	have no evidence that we were involved in any attempt to kidnap you."
12967	'I'm not interested in evidence,' said Johnny. 'I'm curious as to why
12968	you want me here." I heard a rustling behind us and I swiveled quickly,
12969	the
12970	stunner charged and pointed, but the broad circle of Shrike priests
12971	remained motionless. Most were out of the stunner's range. I wished
12972	that I had brought my father's projectile weapon with me.
12973	The bishop's voice was deep and textured and seemed to fill the huge
12974	space. 'Surely you know that the Church of the Final Atonement has a
12975	deep and abiding interest in
12976	the world of Hyperion."
12977	'Yes."
12978	'And surely you are aware that during the past several centuries the
12979	persona of the Old Earth poet Keats has been woven into the cultural
12980	mythos of the Hyperion colony?"
12981	'Yes. So?"
12982	The bishop rubbed his cheek with a large red ring on one finger. 'So
12983	when you offered to go on the Shrike Pilgrimage we agreed. We were
12984	distressed when you reneged on this offer."
12985	Johnny's look of amazement .was most human. 'I offered? When?"
12986	'Eight local days ago,' said the bishop. 'In this room.
12987	You approached us with the idea."
12988	'Did I say why I wanted to go on the . . . Shrike Pilgrimage?"
12989	'You said that it was... I believe the phrase you used was...
12990	"important for your education." We can show you the recording if you
12991	wish. All such conversations in the Temple are recorded. Or you may
12992	have a duplicate of
12993	the recording to view at your own convenience."
12994	'Yes,' said Johnny.
12995	The bishop nodded and an acolyte or whatever the hell he was disappeared
12996	into the gloom for a moment and returned with a standard video chip in
12997	his hand. The bishop nodded again and the blackrobed man came forward
12998	and handed the chip to Johnny. I kept the stunner ready until the guy
12999	had returned to the semicircle of watchers.
13000	'Why did you send the goondas after us?" I asked. It was the first time
13001	I'd spoken in front of the bishop and my voice sounded too loud and too
13002	raw.
13003	The Shrike holy man made a gesture with one pudgy
13004	hand. 'M. Keats had expressed an interest in joining our holiest
13005	pilgrimage. Since it is our belief that the Final Atonement is drawing
13006	closer each day, this is of no little importance to us. Consequently,
13007	our agents reported that M. Keats may have been the victim of one or
13008	more assaults and that a certain private investigator... you, M.
13009	Lamia... was responsible for destroying the cybrid
13010	bodyguard provided M. Keats by the TechnoCore." 'Bodyguard!" It was my
13011	turn to sound amazed.
13012	'Of course,' said the bishop. He turned toward Johnny. 'The gentleman
13013	with the queue who was recently murdered on the Temple Excursion, was
13014	this not the same man whom you introduced as your bodyguard a week
13015	earlier? He is visible in the recording."
13016	Johnny said nothing. He seemed to be straining to remember something.
13017	'At any rate,' continued the bishop, 'we must have your answer about the
13018	pilgrimage before the week is out.
13019	The Sequoia Sernpervirens departs from the Web in nine local days."
13020	'But that'S a Templar treeship,' said Johnny. 'They don't make the long
13021	leap to Hyperion."
13022	The bishop smiled. 'In this case it does. We have reason to believe
13023	that this may be the last Church-sponsored pilgrimage and we have
13024	chartered the Templar craft to allow as many of the faithful as possible
13025	to make the trip." The bishop gestured and red-and-black-robed men faded
13026	back into darkness. Two exorcists came forward to fold his stool as the
13027	bishop stood. 'Please give us your answer as soon as possible." He was
13028	gone. The remaining exorcist stayed to show us out.
13029	There were no more farcasters. We exited by the main door of the Temple
13030	and stood on the top step of the long staircase, looking down on the
13031	Concourse Mall of Hive Center and breathing in the cool, oil-scented
13032	air.
13033	My father's automatic was in the drawer where I'd left it.
13034	I made sure there was a full load of fl6chettes, palmed the magazine
13035	back in, and carried the weapon into the kitchen where breakfast was
13036	cooking. Johnny sat at the long table, staring down through gray
13037	windows at the
13038	loading dock. I carried the omelets over and set one in front of him.
13039	He looked up as I poured the coffee.
13040	'Do you believe him?" I asked. 'That it was your idea7' 'You saw the
13041	video recording." 'Recordings can be faked." 'Yes. But this one
13042	wasn't."
13043	'Then why did you volunteer to go on this pilgrimage?
13044	And why did your bodyguard try to kill you after you talked to the
13045	Shrike Church and the Templar captain?"
13046	Johnny tried the omelet, nodded, and took another forkful. 'The...
13047	bodyguard... is a complete unknown to me. He must have been assigned
13048	to me during the week lost to memory. His real purpose obviously was to
13049	make sure that I did not discover something... or, if I did stumble
13050	upon it, to eliminate me."
13051	'Something in the Web or in datumplane?"
13052	'In the Web, I presume."
13053	'We need to know who he... it... worked for and why they assigned him
13054	to you."
13055	'I do know,' said Johnny. 'I just asked. The Core responds that I
13056	requested a bodyguard. The cybrid was controlled by an AI nexus which
13057	corresponds to a security force."
13058	'Ask why he tried to kill you."
13059	'I did. They emphatically deny that such a thing is possible."
13060	'Then why was this so-called bodyguard slinking around after you a week
13061	after the murder?"
13062	'They respond that while I did not request security again after my...
13063	discontinuity... the Core authorities felt that it would be prudent to
13064	provide protection."
13065	I laughed. 'Some protection. Why the hell did he run on the Templar
13066	world when I caught up to him? They aren't
13067	even trying to give you a plausible story, Johnny."
13068	'No."
13069	'Nor did the bishop explain how the Shrike Church had farcaster access
13070	to Old Earth... or whatever you call that stage-set world."
13071	'And we did not ask."
13072	'/didn't ask because I wanted to get out of that damn Temple in one
13073	piece."
13074	Johnny didn't seem to hear. He was sipping his coffee,
13075	his gaze focused somewhere else.
13076	'What?" I said.
13077	He turned to look at me, tapping his thumbnail on his
13078	lower lip. 'There is a paradox here, Brawne."
13079	'What7'
13080	'If it was truly my aim to go to Hyperion... for my cybrid to travel
13081	there... I could not have remained in the TechnoCore. I would have had
13082	to invest all consciousness in the cybrid itself."
13083	'Why?" But even as I asked I saw the reason.
13084	'Think. Datumplane itself is an abstract. A commingling of computer
13085	and AI-generated dataspheres and the quasi-perceptual Gibsonian matrix
13086	designed originally for human operators, now accepted as common ground
13087	for man, machine, and AI."
13088	'But AI hardware exists somewhere in real space,' I said. 'Somewhere in
13089	the TechnoCore."
13090	'Yes, but that is irrelevant to the function of AI consciousness,' said
13091	Johnny. 'I can "be" anywhere the overlapping dataspheres allow me to
13092	travel . . . all of the Web worlds, of course, datumplane, and any of
13093	the TechnoCore constructs such as Old Earth... but it's only within
13094	that milieu that I can claim "consciousness" or operate sensors or
13095	remotes such as this cybrid."
13096	I set my coffee cup down and stared at the thing I had loved as a man
13097	during the night just past. 'Yes?"
13098	'The colony worlds have limited dataspheres,' said Johnny. 'While there
13099	is some contact with the Techno-Core via fatline transmissions, it is an
13100	exchange of data only... rather like the First Information Age computer
13101	interfaces ... rather than a flow of consciousness.
13102	Hyperion's datasphere is primitive to the point of nonexistence.
13103	And from what I can access, the Core has no contact whatsoever with that
13104	world."
13105	'Would that be normaIT I asked. 'I mean with a colony world that far
13106	away?"
13107	'No. The Core has contact with every colony world, with such
13108	interstellar barbarians as the Ousters, and with other sources the
13109	Hegemony could not imagine."
13110	I sat stunned. 'With the Ousters?" Since the war on
13111	Bressia a few years earlier, the Ousters had been the Web's prime
13112	bogeymen. The idea of the Core . . . the same congregation of Als
13113	which advises the Senate and the All Thing and which allows our entire
13114	economy, farcaster system, and technological civilization to run · . .
13115	the idea of the Core being in touch with the Ousters was frightening.
13116	And what the hell did Johnny mean by 'other sources'? I didn't really
13117	want to know right then.
13118	'But you said it is possible for your cybrid to travel there?" I said.
13119	'What did you mean by "investing all consciousness" in your cybrid? Can
13120	an AI become...
13121	human? Can you exist only in your cybrid?"
13122	'It has been done,' Johnny said softly. 'Once. A personality
13123	reconstruction not too different from my own.
13124	A twentieth-century poet named Ezra Pound. He abandoned his AI persona
13125	and fled from the Web in his
13126	cybrid. But the Pound reconstruction was insane." 'Or sane,' I said.
13127	'Yes."
13128	'So all of the data and personality of an AI can survive in a cybrid's
13129	organic brain."
13130	'Of course not, Brawne. Not one percent of one percent of my total
13131	consciousness would survive the transition. Organic brains can't
13132	process even the most primitive information the way we can. The
13133	resultant personality would not be the AI persona . . . neither would
13134	it be a truly human consciousness or cybrid..." Johnny stopped in
13135	mid-sentence and turned quickly to look out the window.
13136	After a long minute I said, 'What is it?" I reached out a hand but did
13137	not touch him.
13138	He spoke without turning. 'Perhaps I was wrong to say that the
13139	consciousness would not be human,' he whispered. 'It is possible that
13140	the resulting persona could be human touched with a certain divine
13141	madness and meta-human perspective. It could be . . . if purged of
13142	all memory of our age, of all consciousness of the Core · . . it could
13143	be the person the cybrid was programmed to be..."
13144	'John Keats,' I said.
13145	Johnny turned away from the window and closed his eyes. His voice was
13146	hoarse with emotion. It was the first time I had heard him recite
13147	poetry:
13148	'Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave A paradise for a sect,
13149	the savage too
13150	From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep Guesses at Heaven; pity
13151	these have not
13152	Traced upon vellum or wild Indian leaf
13153	The shadows of melodious utterance.
13154	But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die;
13155	For Poesy alone can tell her dreams,
13156	With the fine spell of words alone can save Imagination from the sable
13157	charm
13158	And dumb enchantment. Who alive can say, "Thou art no Poet - mayst not
13159	tell thy dreams"?
13160	Since every man whose soul is not a clod
13161	Hath visions, and would speak, if he had loved, And been well nurtured
13162	in his mother tongue.
13163	Whether the dream now purposed to rehearse
13164	Be Poet's or Fanatic's will be known
13165	When this warm scribe my hand is in the grave."
13166	'I don't get it,' I said. 'What does it mean?"
13167	'It means,' said Johnny, smiling gently, 'that I know what decision I
13168	made and why I made it. I wanted to cease being a cybrid and become a
13169	man. I wanted to go to Hyperion. I still do."
13170	'Somebody killed you for that decision a week ago,' I said.
13171	'Yes."
13172	'And you're going to try again?"
13173	'Yes."
13174	'Why not invest consciousness in your cybrid here?
13175	Become human in the Web?"
13176	'It would never work,' said Johnny. 'What you see as a complex
13177	interstellar society is only a small part of the Core reality matrix. I
13178	would be constantly confronted with and at the mercy of the Als. The
13179	Keats persona...
13180	reality... would never survive."
13181	'All right,' I said, 'you need to get out of the Web. But there are
13182	other colonies. Why Hyperion?"
13183	Johnny took my hand. His finger were long and warm and strong. 'Don't
13184	you see, Brawne? There is some con-neetion here. It may well be that
13185	Keats's dreams of Hyperion were some sort of transtemporal communication
13186	between his then persona and his now persona. If nothing else, Hyperion
13187	is the key mystery of our age - physical and poetic - and it is quite
13188	probable that he... that I was born, died, and was born again to
13189	explore it."
13190	'It sounds like madness to me,' I said. 'Delusions of grandeur."
13191	'Almost certainly,' laughed Johnny. 'And I never have been happier!" He
13192	grabbed my arms and brought me to my feet, his arms around me. 'Will
13193	you go with me, Brawne? Go with me to Hyperion?"
13194	I blinked in surprise, both at his question and the answer, which filled
13195	me like a rush of warmth. 'Yes,' I said. 'I'II go."
13196	We went into the sleeping area then and made love the rest of that day,
13197	sleeping finally to awaken to the low light of Shift Three in the
13198	industrial trench outside.
13199	Johnny was lying on his back, his hazel eyes open and staring at the
13200	ceiling, lost in thought. But not so lost he did not smile and put his
13201	arm around me. I nestled my cheek against him, settling into the small
13202	curve where shoulder meets chest, and went back to sleep.
13203	I was wearing my best clothes - a suit of black whipcord, a blouse woven
13204	of Renaissance silk with a Carvnel blood-stone at the throat, a cocked
13205	Eulin Br6 tricorne - when Johnny and I farcast to TC2 the next day. I
13206	left him in the wood and brass bar near the central terminex, but not
13207	before I slid Dad's automatic across to him in a paper bag and told him
13208	to shoot anyone who even looked cross-eyed at him.
13209	'Web English is such a subtle tongue,' he said.
13210	'That phrase is older than the Web,' I said. 'Just do it." I squeezed
13211	his hand and left without looking back.
13212	I took a skycab to the Administration Complex and walked my way through
13213	about nine security checks before they let me into the Center grounds. I
13214	walked the half klick across Deer Park, admiring the swans in the nearby
13215	lake and the white buildings on the hilltop in the distance, and then
13216	there were nine more checkpoints before a Center security woman led me
13217	up the flagstoned path to Government House, a low, graceful building set
13218	amid flower gardens and landscaped hills. There was an elegantly
13219	furnished waiting room but I barely had time to sit down on an authentic
13220	pre-Hegira de Kooning before an aide appeared and ushered me into the
13221	CEO's private office.
13222	Meina Gladstone came around the desk to shake my hand and show me to a
13223	chair. It was strange to see her in person again after all those years
13224	of watching her on HTV. She was even more impressive in the flesh: her
13225	hair was cut short but seemed to be blowing back in gray-white waves;
13226	her cheeks and chin were as sharp and Lincolnesque as all the
13227	history-prone pundits insisted, but it was the large, sad, brown eyes
13228	which dominated the face and made one feel as if he or she were in the
13229	presence of a truly original person.
13230	I found that my mouth was dry. 'Thank you for seeing me, M. Executive.
13231	I know how busy you are."
13232	'I'm never too busy to see you, Brawne. Just as your father was never
13233	too busy to see me when I was a junior senator."
13234	I nodded. Dad had once described Meina Gladstone as the only political
13235	genius in the Hegemony. He knew that she would be CEO someday despite
13236	her late start in poli tics. I wished Dad had lived to see it.
13237	'How is your mother, Brawne?"
13238	'She's well, M. Executive. She rarely leaves our old summer place on
13239	Freeholm anymore but I see her every Christmas Fest."
13240	Gladstone nodded. She had been sitting casually on the edge of a
13241	massive desk which the tabloids said had once belonged to an
13242	assassinated President- not Lincoln - of the pre-Mistake USA, but now
13243	she smiled and went around to the simple chair behind it. 'I miss your
13244	father, Brawne. I wish he were in this administration.
13245	Did you see the lake when you came in?"
13246	'Yes."
13247	'Do you remember sailing toy boats there with my Kresten when you were
13248	both toddlers?"
13249	'Just barely, M. Executive. I was pretty young."
13250	Meina Gladstone smiled. An intercom chimed but she waved it into
13251	silence. 'How can I help you, Brawne?"
13252	I took a breath. 'M. Executive, you may be aware that I'm working as
13253	an independent private investigator..." I didn't wait for her nod. 'A
13254	case I've been working on recently has led me back to Dad's suicide..."
13255	'Brawne, you know that was investigated most thoroughly.
13256	I saw the commission's report."
13257	'Yeah,' I said. 'I did too. But recently l've discovered some very
13258	strange things about the TechnoCore and its attitude toward the world
13259	Hyperion. Weren't you and Dad working on a bill that would have brought
13260	Hyperion into the Hegemony Protectorate?"
13261	Gladstone nodded. 'Yes, Brawne, but there were over a dozen other
13262	colonies being considered that year. None were allowed in."
13263	'Right. But did the Core or the AI Advisory Council take a special
13264	interest in Hyperion?"
13265	The CEO tapped a stylus against her lower lip. 'What kind of
13266	information do you have, Brawne?" I started to answer but she held up a
13267	blunt finger. 'Wait!" She keyed an interactive. 'Thomas, VII be
13268	stepping out for a few minutes. Please be sure that the Sol Draconi
13269	trade delegation is entertained if I fail a bit behind schedule."
13270	I didn't see her key anything else but suddenly a blue and gold
13271	farcaster portai hummed into life near the far wall. She gestured me to
13272	go through first.
13273	A plain of gold, knee-high grass stretched to horizons which seemed
13274	farther away than most. The sky was a pale yellow with burnished copper
13275	streaks which may have been clouds. I didn't recognize the world.
13276	Meina Gladstone stepped through and touched the comlog design on her
13277	sleeve. The farcaster portal winked out. A warm breeze blew spice
13278	scents to us.
13279	Gladstone touched her sleeve again, glanced skyward, and nodded. 'I'm
13280	sorry for the inconvenience, Brawne.
13281	Kastrop-Rauxel has no datasphere or sats of any kind.
13282	NOw please go ahead with what you were saying. What kind of information
13283	have you come across?"
13284	I looked around at the empty grasslands. 'Nothing to warrant this
13285	security... probably. l've just discovered that the TechnoCore seems
13286	very interested in Hyperion.
13287	They've also built some sort of analog to Old Earth... an entire
13288	world!'
13289	If I expected shock or surprise I was disappointed.
13290	Gladstone nodded. 'Yes. We know about the Old Earth analog."
13291	I was shocked. 'Then why hasn't it even been announced? If the Core
13292	can rebuild Old Earth, a lot of people would be interested."
13293	Gladstone began walking and I strolled with her, walking faster to keep
13294	up with her long-legged strides.
13295	'Brawne, it would not be in the Hegemony's interest to announce it. Our
13296	best !uman intelligence sources have no idea why the Core is doing such
13297	a thing. They have offered no insight. The best policy now is to wait.
13298	What information do you have about Hyperion?"
13299	I had no idea whether I could trust Meina Gladstone, old times or not.
13300	But I knew that if I was going to get information I would have to give
13301	some. 'They built an analog reconstruction of an Old Earth poet,' I
13302	said, 'and they seem obsessed with keeping any information about
13303	Hyperion away from him."
13304	Gladstone picked a long stem of grass and sucked on it.
13305	'The John Keats cybrid."
13306	'Yes." I was careful not to show surprise this time. 'I know that Dad
13307	was pushing hard to get Protectorate status for Hyperion. If the Core
13308	has some special interest in the place, they may have had something to
13309	do... may have manipulated..."
13310	'His apparent suicide?"
13311	'Yeah?"
13312	The wind moved gold grass in waves. Something very small scurried away
13313	in the stalks at our feet. 'It is not beyond the realm of possibility,
13314	Brawne. But there was absolutely no evidence. Tell me what this cybrid
13315	is going to do."
13316	'First tell me why the Core is so interested in Hyperion."
13317	The older woman spread her hands. 'If we knew that, Brawne, I would
13318	sleep much easier nights. As far as we know, the TechnoCore has been
13319	obsessed with Hyperion for centuries. When CEO Yevshensky allowed King
13320	Billy of Asquith to recolonize the planet, it almost precipitated a true
13321	secession of AIs from the Web. Recently the establishment of our
13322	fatline transmitter there brought about a similar crisis."
13323	'But the AIs didn't secede."
13324	'No, Brawne, it appears that, for whatever reason, they need us almost
13325	as badly as we need them."
13326	'But if they're so interested in Hyperion, why don't they allow it into
13327	the Web so they can go there themselves?"
13328	Gladstone ran a hand through her hair. The bronze clouds far above
13329	rippled in what must be a fantastic jet stream. 'They are adamant about
13330	Hyperion not being admitted to the Web,' she said. 'It is an
13331	interesting paradox.
13332	Tell me what the cybrid is going to do."
13333	'First tell me why the Core is obsessed with Hyperion." 'We do not know
13334	for sure." 'Best guess then."
13335	CEO Gladstone removed the stem of grass from her mouth and regarded it.
13336	'We believe that the Core is embarked on a truly incredible project
13337	which would allow them to predict . . . everything. To handle every
13338	variable of space, time, and history as a quantum of manageable
13339	information."
13340	'Their Ultimate Intelligence Project,' I said, knowing that I was being
13341	careless and not caring.
13342	This time CEO Gladstone did register shock. 'How do you know about
13343	that?"
13344	'What does that project have to do with Hyperion?" Gladstone sighed. 'We
13345	don't know for sure, Brawne.
13346	But we do know that there is an anomaly on Hyperion which they have not
13347	been able to factor into their predictive analyses. Do you know about
13348	the so-called Time Tombs that the Shrike Church holds holy?"
13349	'Sure. They've been off limits to tourists for a while."
13350	'Yes. Because of an accident to a researcher there a few decades ago,
13351	our scientists have confirmed that the anti-entropic fields around the
13352	Tombs are not merely a protection against time's erosive effects as has
13353	been widely believed."
13354	'What are they?"
13355	'The remnants of a field... or force... which has actually propelled
13356	the Tombs and their contents backward in time from some distant future."
13357	'Contents?" I managed. 'But the Tombs are empty.
13358	Ever since they were discovered."
13359	'Empty now,' said Meina Gladstone. 'But there is evidence that they
13360	were full... will be full... when they open. In our near future."
13361	I stared at her. 'How near?"
13362	Her dark eyes remained soft but the movement of her head was final.
13363	'l've told you too much already, Brawne.
13364	You are forbidden to repeat it. We'll ensure that silence if
13365	necessary."
13366	I hid my own confusion by finding a piece of grass to strip for chewing.
13367	'All right,' I said. 'What's going to come out of the Tombs? Aliens?
13368	Bombs? Some sort of reverse time capsules?"
13369	Gladstone smiled tightly. 'If we knew that, Brawne, we would be ahead
13370	of the Core, and we are not." The smile disappeared. 'One hypothesis is
13371	that the Tombs relate to some future war. A settling of future scores
13372	by rearranging the past, perhaps."
13373	'A war between who, for Chrissakes?"
13374	She opened her hands again. 'We need to be getting back, Brawne. Would
13375	you please tell me what the Keats cybrid is going to do now?"
13376	I looked down and then back up to meet her steady gaze. I couldn't
13377	trust anyone, but the Core and the Shrike Church already knew Johnny's
13378	plans. If this was a three-sided game, perhaps each side should know in
13379	case there was a good guy in the bunch, 'He's going to invest all
13380	consciousness in the cybrid,' I said rather clumsily. 'He's going to
13381	become human, M. Gladstone, and then go to Hyperion. I'm going with
13382	him."
13383	The CEO of the Senate and All Thing, chief officer for a government
13384	which spanned almost two hundred worlds and billions of people, stared
13385	at me in silence for a
13386	long moment. Then she said, 'He plans to go with the
13387	Templar ship on the pilgrimage then."
13388	'Yes."
13389	'No,' said Meina Gladstone.
13390	'What do you mean?"
13391	'I mean that the Sequoia Sempervirens will not be allowed to leave
13392	Hegemony space. There will be no pilgrimage unless the Senate decides
13393	it is in our interest." Her voice was iron-hard.
13394	'Johnny and VII go by spinship,' I said. 'The pilgrimage is a loser's
13395	game anyway."
13396	'No,' she said. 'There will be no more civilian spin-ships to Hyperion
13397	for some time."
13398	The word 'civilian' tipped me. 'War?"
13399	Gladstone's lips were tight. She nodded. 'Before most
13400	spinships could reach the region."
13401	'A war with... the Ousters?"
13402	'Initially. View it as a way to force the issue between the TechnoCore
13403	and ourselves, Brawne. We will either have to incorporate the Hyperion
13404	system into the Web to allow it FORCE protection, or it will fall to a
13405	race which despises and distrusts the Core and all Als."
13406	I didn't mention Johnny's comment that the Core had been in touch with
13407	the Ousters. I said, 'A way to force the issue. Fine. But who
13408	manipulated the Ousters into attacking?"
13409	Gladstone looked at me. If her face was Lincolnesque at that moment,
13410	then Old Earth's Lincoln was one tough son of a bitch. 'It's time to
13411	get back, Brawne. You appreciate how important it is that none of this
13412	information gets out."
13413	'I appreciate the fact that you wouldn't have told me unless you had a
13414	reason to,' I said. 'I don't know who you want the stuff to go to, but
13415	I know l'm a messenger, not a confidante."
13416	'Don't underestimate our resolve to keep this classified, Brawne."
13417	I laughed. 'Lady, I wouldn't underestimate your resolve in anything."
13418	Meina Gladstone gestured for me to step through the farcaster portal
13419	first.
13420	' I know a way we can discover what the Core is up to,' said Johnny as
13421	we rode alone in a rented jetboat on Mare
13422	I nfinitus. 'But it would be dangerous."
13423	'So what else is new?"
13424	'I'm serious. We should only attempt it if we feel that it is
13425	imperative to understand what the Core fears from
13426	Hyperion."
13427	'Ido."
13428	'We will need an operative. Someone who is an artist in datumplane
13429	operations. Someone smart but not so smart that they won't take a
13430	chance. And someone who would risk everything and keep the secret just
13431	for the ultimate in cyberpuke pranks."
13432	I grinned at Johnny. 'l'vegot just the man."
13433	BB lived alone in a cheap apartment at the base of a cheap tower in a
13434	cheap TC2 neighborhood. But there was nothing cheap about the hardware
13435	that filled most of the space in the four-room flat. Most of BB's
13436	salary for the past standard decade had gone into state-of-the art
13437	cyberpuke toys.
13438	I started by saying that we wanted him to do something illegal. BB said
13439	that, as a public employee, he couldn't consider such a thing. He asked
13440	what the thing was. Johnny began to explain. BB leaned forward and I
13441	saw the old cyberpuke gleam in his eyes from our college days. I half
13442	expected him to try to dissect Johnny right there just to see how a
13443	cybrid worked. Then Johnny got to the interesting part and BB's gleam
13444	turned into a sort of green glow.
13445	'When I self-destruct my AI persona,' said Johnny, 'the shift to cybrid
13446	consciousness will take only nanoseconds, but during that time my
13447	section of the Core perimeter defenses will drop. The security phages
13448	will fill the gap before too many more nanoseconds pass, but during the
13449	time..."
13450	'Entry to the Core,' whispered BB, his eyes glowing like some antique
13451	VDT.
13452	'It would be very dangerous,' stressed Johnny. 'To my knowledge, no
13453	human operator has ever penetrated Core periphery."
13454	BB rubbed his upper lip. 'There's a legend that Cowboy
13455	Gibson did it before the Core seceded,' he mumbled.
13456	'But nobody believes it. And Cowboy disappeared."
13457	'Even if you penetrate,' said Johnny, 'there would be insufficient time
13458	to access except for the fact that I have the data coordinates."
13459	'Fan-fucking-tastic,' whispered BB. He turned back
13460	to his console and reached for his shunt. 'Let's do it." 'Now?" I said.
13461	Even Johnny looked taken aback.
13462	'Why wait?" BB clicked in his shunt and attached metacortex leads, but
13463	left the deck idling. 'Are we doing this, or what?"
13464	I went over next to Johnny on the couch and took his hand. His skin was
13465	cool. He showed no expression now but I could imagine what it must be
13466	like to be facing imminent destruction of one's personality and previous
13467	existence. Even if the transfer worked, the human with
13468	the John Keats persona would not be 'Johnny."
13469	'He's right,' said Johnny. 'Why wait?"
13470	I kissed him. 'All right,' I said. 'l'm going in with BB."
13471	'No!" Johnny squeezed my hand. 'You can't help and the danger would be
13472	terrible."
13473	I heard my own voice, as implacable as Meina Gladstone's. 'Perhaps. But
13474	I can't ask BB to do this if I won't. And I won't leave you in there
13475	alone." I squeezed his hand a final time and went over to sit by BB at
13476	the console. 'How do I connect with this fucking thing, BB?"
13477	You've read all the cyberpuke stuff. You know all about the terrible
13478	beauty of datumplane, the three-dimensional highways with their
13479	landscapes of black ice and neon perimeters and Day-Glo Strange Loops
13480	and shimmering skyscrapers of data blocks under hovering clouds of AI
13481	presence. I saw all of it riding piggyback on BB's carrier wave. It
13482	was almost too much. Too intense. Too terrifying.
13483	I could hear the black threats of the hulking security phages; I could
13484	smell death on the breath of the counterthrust tapeworm viruses even
13485	through the ice screens; I could feel the weight of the AIs' wrath above
13486	us- we were insects under elephants' feet- and we hadn't even done
13487	anything yet except travel approved dataways on a logged-in access
13488	errand BB had dreamed up, some homework stuff for his Flow Control
13489	Records and Statistics job.
13490	And I was wearing stick-on leads, seeing things in a datumplane version
13491	of fuzzy black and white TV while Johnny and BB were viewing full
13492	stimsim holo, as it were.
13493	I don't know how they took it.
13494	'OK,' whispered BB in some datumplane equivalent of a whisper, 'we're
13495	here."
13496	'Where?" All I saw was an infinite maze of bright lights and even
13497	brighter shadows, ten thousand cities arrayed in four dimensions.
13498	'Core periphery,' whispered BB. 'Hang on. It's about time."
13499	I had no arms to hang on with and nothing physical in this universe to
13500	grasp, but I concentrated on the
13501	waveform shades that were our data truck and clung.
13502	Johnny died then.
13503	I've seen a nuclear explosion firsthand. When Dad was a senator he took
13504	Mom and me to Olympus Command School to see a FORCE demonstration. For
13505	the last course the audience viewing pod was farcast to some godforsaken
13506	world . . . Armaghast, I think . . . and a FORCE:ground recon
13507	platoon fired a clean tactical nuke at a pretend adversary some nine
13508	klicks away. The viewing pod was shielded with a class ten containment
13509	field, polarized, the nuke only a fifty-kiloton field tactical, but I'll
13510	never forget the blast, the shock wave rocking the eighty-ton pod like a
13511	leaf on its repellers, the physical shock of light so obscenely bright
13512	that it polarized our field to midnight and still brought tears to our
13513	eyes and
13514	clamored to get in.
13515	This was worse.
13516	A section of datumplane seemed to flash and then to implode on itself,
13517	reality flushed down a drain of pure black.
13518	'Hang on!" BB screamed against datumplane static that rasped at my bones
13519	and we were whirling, tumbling, sucked into the vacuum like insects in
13520	an oceanic vortex.
13521	Somehow, incredibly, impossibly, black-armored phages thrust toward us
13522	through the din and madness.
13523	BB avoided one, turned the other's acid membranes against itself. We
13524	were being sucked into something colder and blacker than any void in our
13525	reality could ever be.
13526	'There!" called BB, his voice analog almost lost in the tornado rush of
13527	ripping datasphere.
13528	There what? Then I saw it: a thin line of yellow rippling in the
13529	turbulence like a cloth banner in a hurricane.
13530	BB rolled us, found our own wave to carry us against the storm, matched
13531	coordinates that danced past me too quickly to see, and we were riding
13532	the yellow band into...
13533	· . . into what? Frozen fountains of fireworks. Transparent mountain
13534	ranges of data, endless glaciers of ROMworks, access ganglia spreading
13535	like fissures, iron clouds of semisentient internal pro:ess bubbles,
13536	glowing pyramids of primary source stuff, each guarded by lakes
13537	of black ice and armies of black-pulse pilages.
13538	'Shit,' I whispered to no one in particular.
13539	BB followed the yellow band down, in, through. I felt a connection as
13540	if someone had suddenly given us a great mass to carry.
13541	'Got it)." screamed BB, and suddenly there was a sound louder and larger
13542	than the maelstrom of noise surrounding and consuming us. It was
13543	neither klaxon nor siren, but it was both in its tone of warning and
13544	aggression.
13545	We were climbing out of it all. I could see a vague wall of gray
13546	through the brilliant chaos and somehow knew it to be the periphery, the
13547	vacuum dwindling but still breaching the wall like a shrinking black
13548	stain. We were climbing out.
13549	But not quickly enough.
13550	The phages hit us from five sides. During the twelve years I've been an
13551	investigator I've been shot once, knifed twice· l'd had more than this
13552	one rib broken. This hurt more than all that combined. BB was fighting
13553	and climbing at the same time.
13554	My contribution to the emergency was to scream. I felt cold claws on
13555	us, pulling us down, back into the brightness and noise and chaos· BB
13556	was using some program, some formula of enchantment to fight them
13557	off. But not enough. I could feel the blows slamming home - not
13558	against me primarily, but connecting to the matrix analog that was BB.
13559	We were sinking back. Inexorable forces had us in tow. Suddenly I felt
13560	Johnny's presence and it was as if a huge, strong hand had scooped us
13561	up, lifted us through the periphery wall an instant before the stain
13562	snapped our lifeline to existence and the defensive field crashed
13563	together like steel teeth.
13564	We moved at impossible speed down congested data-ways, passing
13565	datumplane couriers and other operator analogs like an EMV ripping past
13566	oxcarts. Then we were approaching a slow-time gate, leapfrogging
13567	gridlocked exiting operator analogs in some four-dimensional high jump.
13568	I felt the inevitable nausea of transition as we came out of the matrix.
13569	Light burned my retinas. Real light. Then the pain washed in and I
13570	slumped over the console and groaned.
13571	'Come on, Brawne." It was Johnny - or someone just like Johnny - helping
13572	me to my feet and moving us both toward the door.
13573	'BB,' I gasped.
13574	' No. '
13575	I opened aching eyes long enough to see BB Surbringer draped across his
13576	console. His Stetson had fallen off and rolled to the floor. BB's head
13577	had exploded, spattering most of the console with gray and red. His
13578	mouth was open and a thick white foam still issued from it. It looked
13579	like his eyes had melted.
13580	Johnny caught me, half lifted me. 'We have to go,' he whispered.
13581	'Someone will be here any minute."
13582	I closed my eyes and let him take me away from there.
13583	I awoke to dim red light and the sound of water dripping.
13584	I smelled sewage, mildew, and the ozone of uninsulated power cables. I
13585	opened one eye.
13586	We were in a low space more cave than room with cables snaking from a
13587	shattered ceiling and pools of water on the slime-caked tiles. The red
13588	light came from somewhere beyond the cave- a maintenance access
13589	shaft perhaps, or automech tunnel. I moaned softly.
13590	Johnny was there, moving from the rough bedroll of blankets to my side.
13591	His face was darkened with grease
13592	or dirt and there was at least one fresh cut.
13593	'Where are we?"
13594	He touched my cheek. His other arm went around my shoulders and helped
13595	me to a sitting position. The awful view shifted and tilted and for a
13596	moment I thought I was going to be sick. Johnny helped me drink water
13597	from a plastic tumbler.
13598	'Dregs' Hive,' said Johnny.
13599	l'd guessed even before I was fully conscious. Dregs' Hive is the
13600	deepest pit on Lusus, a no man's land of mech tunnels and illegal
13601	burrows occupied by half the Web's outcasts and outlaws. It was in
13602	Dregs' Hive that I'd been shot several years ago and still bore the
13603	laser scar above my left hipbone.
13604	I held the tumbler out for more water. Johnny fetched some from a steel
13605	therm and came back. I panicked for a second as I fumbled in my tunic
13606	pocket and on my belt: Dad's automatic was gone. Johnny held the weapon
13607	up and I relaxed, accepting the cup and drinking thirstily.
13608	'BB?" I said, hoping for a moment that it had all been a terrible
13609	hallucination.
13610	Johnny shook his head. 'There were defenses that neither of us had
13611	anticipated. BB's incursion was brilliant, but he couldn't outright
13612	Core omega phages. But half the operators in datumplane felt echoes of
13613	the battle. BB is already the stuff of legend."
13614	'Fucking great,' I said and gave a laugh that sounded suspiciously like
13615	the beginning of a sob. 'The stuff of legend. And BB's dead. For
13616	fuck-all nothing."
13617	Johnny's arm was tight around me. 'Not for nothing, Brawne. He made
13618	the grab. And passed the data to me before he died."
13619	I managed to sit fully upright and to look at Johnny.
13620	He seemed the same- the same soft eyes, same hair, same voice. But
13621	something was subtly different, deeper.
13622	More human? 'You?" I said. 'Did you make the transfer?
13623	Are you..."
13624	'Human?" John Keats smiled at me. 'Yes, Brawne. Or
13625	as close to human as someone forged in the Core could ever be."
13626	'But you remember ... me ... BB ... what's happened."
13627	'Yes. And I remember first looking into Chapman's Homer. And my
13628	brother Tom's eyes as he hemorrhaged in the night. And Severn's kind
13629	voice when I was too weak to open my own eyes to face my fate. And our
13630	night in Piazza di Spagna when I touched your lips and imagined Fanny's
13631	cheek against mine. I remember, Brawne."
13632	For a second I was confused, and then hurt, but then he set his palm
13633	against my cheek and he touched me, there was no one else, and I
13634	understood. I closed my eyes. 'Why are we here?" I whispered against
13635	his shirt.
13636	'I couldn't risk using a farcaster. The Core could trace us at once. I
13637	considered the spaceport but you were in no condition to travel. I
13638	chose the Dregs'."
13639	I nodded against him. 'They'll try to kill you."
13640	'Yes."
13641	'Are the local cops after us? The Hegemony police?
13642	Transit cops?"
13643	'No, I don't think so. The only ones who're challenged us so far were
13644	two bands of goondas and some of the Dregs' dwellers."
13645	I opened my eyes. 'What happened with the goondas?" There were more
13646	deadly hoodlums and contract killers in the Web but I'd never run across
13647	any.
13648	Johnny held up Dad's automatic and smiled.
13649	'I don't remember anything after BB,' I said.
13650	'You were injured by the phage backlash. You could walk but we were the
13651	cause of more than a few odd looks in the Concourse."
13652	'I bet. Tell me about what BB discovered. Why is the Core obsessed
13653	with Hyperion?"
13654	'Eat first,' said Johnny. 'It's been more than twenty-eight hours." He
13655	crossed the dripping width of the cave room and returned with a
13656	self-heating packet. It was basic hoio fanatic fare - flash-dried and
13657	reheated cloned beef, potatoes which had never seen soil, and carrots
13658	which looked like some sort of deep-sea slugs. Nothing had ever tasted
13659	so good.
13660	'OK,' I said, 'tell me."
13661	'The TechnoCore has been divided into three groups for as long as the
13662	Core has existed,' said Johnny. 'The Stables are the old-line Als, some
13663	of them dating back to pre-Mistake days; at least one of them gained
13664	sentience in the First Information Age. The Stables argue that a
13665	certain level of symbiosis is necessary between humanity and the Core.
13666	They've promoted the Ultimate Intelligence Project as a way to avoid
13667	rash decisions, to delay until all variables can be factored. The
13668	Volatiles are the force behind the Secession three centuries ago. The
13669	Vola-tiles have done conclusive studies that show how humankind's
13670	usefulness is past and from this point on human beings constitute a
13671	threat to the Core. They advocate immediate and total extinction."
13672	'Extinction,' I said. After a moment I asked, 'Can they do it?"
13673	'Of humans in the Web, yes,' said Johnny. 'Core intelligences not only
13674	create the infrastructure for Hegemony society but are necessary for
13675	everything from FORCE deployment to the failsafes on stockpiled nuclear
13676	and plasma arsenals."
13677	'Did you know about this when you were... in the Core?"
13678	'No,' said Johnny. 'As a pseudo-poet cybrid retrieval project, I was a
13679	freak, a pet, a partial thing allowed to roam the Web the way a pet is
13680	let out of the house each day. I had no idea there were three camps of
13681	AI influence."
13682	'Three camps,' I said. 'What's the third? And where does Hyperion come
13683	in?"
13684	'Between the Stables and the Volatiles are the Ultimates.
13685	For the past five centuries the Ultimates have been obsessed with the UI
13686	Project. The existence or extinction of the human race is of interest
13687	to them only in how it applies to the project. To this date, they have
13688	been a force for moderation, an ally of the Stables, because it is their
13689	perception that such reconstruction and retrieval projects as the Old
13690	Earth experiment are necessary to the culmination of the UI.
13691	'Recently, however, the Hyperion issue has caused the Ultimates to move
13692	toward the Volatiles' views. Since Hyperion was explored four centuries
13693	ago, the Core has been concerned and nonplussed. It was immediately
13694	obvious that the so-called Time Tombs were artifacts launched backward
13695	in time from a point at least ten thousand years in the galaxy's future.
13696	More disturbing, however, is the fact that Core predictive formulae have
13697	never been able to factor the Hyperion variable.
13698	'Brawne, to understand this, you must realize how much the Core relies
13699	upon prediction. Already, without UI input, the Core knows the details
13700	of the physical, human, and AI future to a margin of 98.9995 percent for
13701	a period of at least two centuries. The AI Advisory Council to the All
13702	Thing with its vague, delphic utterancesconsidered so indispensable by
13703	humans- is a joke. The Core drops tidbits of revelations to the
13704	Hegemony when it serves the Core's purposes - sometimes to aid the
13705	Volatiles, sometimes the Stables, but always to please the Ultimates.
13706	'Hyperion is a rent in the entire predictive fabric of the Core's
13707	existence. It is the penultimate oxymoron- a nonfactorable variable.
13708	Impossible as it seems, Hyperion appears to be exempt from the laws of
13709	physics, history, human psychology, and AI prediction as practiced by
13710	the Core.
13711	'The result has been two futures - two realities if you will- one in
13712	which the Shrike scourge soon to be released on the Web and interstellar
13713	humanity is a weapon from the Core-dominated future, a retroactive first
13714	strike from the Volatiles who rule the galaxy millennia hence. The
13715	other reality sees the Shrike invasion, the coming interstellar war, and
13716	the other products of the Time Tombs' opening as a human fist struck
13717	back through time, a final, twilight effort by the Ousters,
13718	ex-colonials, and other small bands of humans who escaped the Volatiles'
13719	extinction programs."
13720	Water dripped on tile. Somewhere in the tunnels nearby a mech
13721	cauterizer's warning siren echoed from ceramic and stone. I leaned
13722	against the wall and stared at Johnny.
13723	'Interstellar war,' I said. 'Both scenarios demand an interstellar
13724	war?"
13725	'Yes. There is no escaping that."
13726	'Can both Core groups be wrong in their prediction?" 'No. What happens
13727	on Hyperion is problematic, but the disruption in the Web and elsewhere
13728	is quite clear.
13729	The Ultimates use this knowledge as the prime argument for hurrying the
13730	next step in Core evolution."
13731	'And what did BB's stolen data show about us, Johnny?"
13732	Johnny smiled, touched my hand, but did not hold it.
13733	'It showed that I am somehow part of the Hyperion unknown. Their
13734	creation of a Keats cybrid was a terrible amble. Only my apparent lack
13735	of success as a Keats analog allowed the Stables to preserve me. When I
13736	made up my mind to go to Hyperion, the Volatiles killed me with the
13737	clear intention of obliterating my AI existence if
13738	my cybrid again made that decision."
13739	'You did. What happened?"
13740	'They failed. In the Co.re's limitless arrogance, they failed to take
13741	two things into account. First, that I might invest all consciousness
13742	in my cybrid and thus change the nature of the Keats analog. Second,
13743	that I would go to you."
13744	'Me!'
13745	He took my hand. 'Yes, Brawne. It seems that you also are part of the
13746	Hyperion unknown."
13747	I shook my head. Realizing that there was a numbness in my scalp above
13748	and behind my left ear, I raised my hand, half expecting to find damage
13749	from the datumplane fight. Instead, my fingers encountered the plastic
13750	of a neural shunt socket.
13751	I jerked my other hand from Johnny's grasp and stared at him in horror.
13752	He'd had me wired while I was unconscious.
13753	Johnny held up both hands, palms toward me. 'I had to, Brawne. It may
13754	be necessary for the survival of both of us."
13755	I made a fist. 'You fucking low-life son of a bitch.
13756	Why do I need to interface directly, you lying bastard?"
13757	'Not with the Core,' Johnny said softly. 'With me."
13758	'You?" My arm and fist quivered with the anticipation of smashing his
13759	vat-cloned face. 'You!" I sneered.
13760	'You're human now remember?"
13761	'Yes. But certain cybrid functions remain. Do you remember when I
13762	touched your hand several days ago and brought us to datumplane?"
13763	I stared at him. 'I'm not going to datumplane again." 'No. Nor am I.
13764	But I may need to relay incredible amounts of data to you within a very
13765	short period of time. I brought you to a black market surgeon in the
13766	Dregs' last night. She implanted a SchrOn loop."
13767	'Why?" The SchrOn loop was tiny, no larger than my thumbnail, and very
13768	expensive. It held countless field-bubble memories, each capable of
13769	holding near infinite bits of information. $chrOn loops could not be
13770	accessed by the biological carrier and thus were used for courier
13771	purposes. ^ man or woman could carry AI personalities or entire
13772	planetary dataspheres in a Schrn loop. Hell, a dog could carry all
13773	that.
13774	'Why?" I said again, wondering if Johnny or some forces behind Johnny
13775	were using me as such a courier.
13776	'Why?"
13777	Johnny moved closer and put his hand around my fist.
13778	'Trust me, Brawne."
13779	I don't think I'd trusted anyone since Dad blew his brains out twenty
13780	years ago and Mom retreated into the pure selfishness of her seclusion.
13781	There was no reason in
13782	the universe to trust Johnny now.
13783	But I did.
13784	I relaxed my fist and took his hand.
13785	'All right,' said Johnny. 'Finish your meal and we'll get busy trying
13786	to save our lives."
13787	Weapons and drugs were the two easiest things to buy in Dregs' Hive. We
13788	spent the last of Johnny's considerable stash of black marks to buy
13789	weapons.
13790	By 2200 hours, we each wore whiskered titan-poly body armor. Johnny had
13791	a goonda's mirror-black helmet and I wore a FORCE-surplus command mask.
13792	Johnny's power gauntlets were massive and a bright red.
13793	I wore osmosis gloves with killing trim. Johnny carried
13794	an Ouster hellwhip captured on Bressia and had tucked a laser wand in
13795	his belt. Along with Dad's automatic, I now carried a Steiner-Ginn
13796	mini-gun on a gyroed waist brace. It was slaved to my command visor and
13797	I could keep both hands free while firing.
13798	Johnny and I looked at each other and began giggling.
13799	When the laughter stopped there was a long silence.
13800	'Are you sure the Shrike Temple here on Lusus is our best chance?" I
13801	asked for the third or fourth time."
13802	'We can't farcast,' said Johnny. 'All the Core has to do is record a
13803	malfunction and we're dead. We can't even take an elevator from the
13804	lower levels. We'll have to find unmonitored stairways and climb the
13805	hundred and twenty floors. The best chance to make the Temple is
13806	straight down the Concourse Mall."
13807	'Yes, but will the Shrike Church people take us in?" Johnny shrugged, a
13808	strangely insectoid gesture in his combat outfit. The voice through the
13809	goonda helmet was metallic. 'They're the only group which has a vested
13810	interest in our survival. And the only ones with enough political pull
13811	to shield us from the Hegemony while finding transit for us to
13812	Hyperion."
13813	I pushed up my visor. 'Meina Gladstone said that no future pilgrimage
13814	flights to Hyperion would be allowed."
13815	The dome of mirror black nodded judiciously. 'Well, fuck Meina
13816	Gladstone,' said my poet lover.
13817	I took a breath and walked to the opening of our niche, our cave, our
13818	last sanctuary. Johnny came up behind me. Body armor rubbed against
13819	body armor.
13820	'Ready, Brawne?"
13821	I nodded, brought the mini-gun around on its pivot, and started to
13822	leave.
13823	Johnny stopped me with a touch. 'I love you, Brawne."
13824	I nodded, still tough. I forgot that my visor was up and he could see
13825	my tears.
13826	The Hive is awake all twenty-eight hours of the day, but through some
13827	tradition, Third Shift was the quietest, the least populated. We would
13828	have had a better chance at the height of First Shift rush hour along
13829	the pedestrian
13830	causeways. But if the goondas and thuggees were waiting for us, the
13831	death toll of civilians would have been staggering.
13832	It took us more than three hours to climb our way to Concourse Mall, not
13833	up a single staircase but along an endless series of mech corridors,
13834	abandoned access verticals swept clean by the Luddite riots eighty years
13835	ago, and a final stairway that was more rust than metal. We exited onto
13836	a delivery corridor less than half a klick from the Shrike Temple.
13837	'I can't believe it was so easy,' I whispered to him on intercom.
13838	'They are probably concentrating people on the space-port and private
13839	farcaster clusters."
13840	We took the least exposed walkway onto the Concourse, thirty meters
13841	below the first shopping level and four hundred meters below the roof.
13842	The Shrike Temple was an ornate, free-stranding structure now less than
13843	half a klick away. A few off-hour shoppers and joggers glanced at us
13844	and then moved quickly away. I had no doubt that the Mall police were
13845	being paged, but I'd be surprised if they showed up too quickly.
13846	A gang of brightly painted street thugs exploded from a lift shaft,
13847	hollering and whooping. They carried pulse-knives, chains, and power
13848	gauntlets. Startled, Johnny wheeled toward them with the hellwhip
13849	sending out a score of targeting beams. The mini-gun whir-whirred out
13850	of my hands, shifting from aiming point to aiming point as I moved my
13851	eyes.
13852	The gang of seven kids skidded to a halt, held up their hands, and
13853	backed away, eyes wide. They dropped into the lift shaft and were gone.
13854	I looked at Johnny. Black mirrors looked back. Neither of us laughed.
13855	We crossed to the northbound shopping lane. The few pedestrians
13856	scurried for open shopfronts. We were less than a hundred meters from
13857	the Temple stairs. I could actually hear my heartbeat in the FORCE
13858	helmet ear-phones.
13859	We were within fifty meters of the stairs. As if called, an acolyte or
13860	priest of some sort appeared at the ten-meter door of the Temple and
13861	watched us approach.
13862	Thirty meters. If anyone was going to intercept us, they would have
13863	done it before this.
13864	I turned toward Johnny to say something funny. At least twenty beams
13865	and half that many projectiles hit us at once. The outer layer of the
13866	titan-poly exploded outward, deflecting most of the projectile energy in
13867	the counterblast. rhe mirrored surface beneath bounced most of the
13868	killing light. Most of it.
13869	Johnny was flung off his feet by the impact. I went to one knee and let
13870	the mini-gun train on the laser source.
13871	Ten stories up along the residential Hive wall. My visor opaqued. Body
13872	armor burned off in a steam of reflective gas. The mini-gun sounded
13873	precisely like the kind' of chainsaw they used in history hoiodramas.
13874	Ten stories up, a five-meter section of balcony and wall disintegrated
13875	in a cloud of explosive flchettes and armor-piercing rounds.
13876	Three heavy slugs struck me from behind.
13877	I landed on my palms, silenced the mini-gun, and swiveled. There were
13878	at least a dozen of them on each level, moving quickly in precise combat
13879	choreography.
13880	Johnny had reached his knees and was firing the hell-whip in
13881	orchestrated bursts of light, working his way through the rainbow to
13882	beat bounce defenses.
13883	One of the running figures exploded into flame as the shopwindow behind
13884	it turned to molten glass and spattered fifteen meters onto the
13885	Concourse. Two more men came up over the level railings and I sent them
13886	back with a burst from the mini-gun.
13887	An open skimmer came down from the rafters, repellers laboring as it
13888	banked around pylons. Rocket fire slammed into concrete around Johnny
13889	and me. Shop-fronts vomited a billion shards of glass over us. I
13890	looked, blinked twice, targeted, and fired. The skimmer lurched
13891	sideways, struck an escalator with a dozen cowering civilians on it, and
13892	tumbled in a mass of twisting metal and exploding ordnance. I saw one
13893	shopper leap in flames to the Hive floor eighty meters below.
13894	'Left!" shouted Johnny over the tightbeam intercom.
13895	Four men in combat armor had dropped from an upper level using personal
13896	lift packs. The polymerized chameleon armor labored to keep up with the
13897	shifting Iackground but only succeeded in turning each man into a
13898	brilliant kaleidoscope of reflections. One moved inside the sweep arch
13899	of my mini-gun to neutralize me while the other three went for Johnny.
13900	He came in with a pulse-blade, ghetto style. I let it chew at my armor,
13901	knowing it would get through to forearm flesh but using it to buy the
13902	second I needed. I got it. I killed the man with the rigid edge of my
13903	gauntlet and swept the mini-gun fire into the three worrying Johnny.
13904	Their armor went rigid and I used the gun to sweep them backward like
13905	someone hosing down a littered sidewalk.
13906	Only one of the men got to his feet before I blew them all off the level
13907	overhang.
13908	Johnny was down again. Parts of his chest armor were gone, melted away.
13909	I smelled cooking flesh but saw no mortal wounds. I half crouched,
13910	lifted him.
13911	'Leave me, Brawne. Run. The stairs." The tightbeam was breaking up.
13912	'Fuck off,' I said, getting my left arm around him enough to support him
13913	while allowing room for the mini-gun to track. 'l'm still getting paid
13914	to be your bodyguard."
13915	They were sniping at us from both walls of the Hive, the rafters, and
13916	the shopping levels above us. I counted at least twenty bodies on the
13917	walkways; about half were brightly clad civilians. The power assist on
13918	the left leg of my armor was grinding. Straight-legged, I awkwardly
13919	pulled us another ten meters toward the Temple stairs.
13920	There were several Shrike priests at the head of the stairs now,
13921	seemingly oblivious to the gunfire all around them.
13922	'Above!'
13923	I swiveled, targeted, and fired in one moment, hearing the gun go empty
13924	after one burst and seeing the second skimmer get off its missiles in
13925	the instant before it became a thousand pieces of hurtling, unrelated
13926	metal and torn flesh. I dropped Johnny heavily to the pavement and fell
13927	on him, trying to cover his exposed flesh with my body.
13928	The missiles detonated simultaneously, several in
13929	airburst and at least two burrowing. Johnny and I were lifted into the
13930	air and hurled fifteen or twenty meters down the pitching walkway. Good
13931	thing. The alloy and ferroconcrete pedestrian strip where we had been a
13932	second before burned, bubbled, sagged, and tumbled down onto the flaming
13933	walkway below. There was a natural moat there now, a gap between most
13934	of the other ground troops and us.
13935	I rose, slapped away the useless mini-gun and mount, pulled off useless
13936	shards of my own armor, and lifted Johnny in both arms. His helmet had
13937	been blown off and his face was very bad. Blood seeped through a score
13938	of gaps in his armor. His right arm and left foot had been blown off. I
13939	turned and began carrying him up the Shrike Temple stairs.
13940	There were sirens and security skimmers filling the Concourse flyspace
13941	now. The goondas on the upper levels and far side of the tumbled
13942	walkway ran for cover.
13943	Two of the commandos who had dropped on lift packs ran up the stairs
13944	after me. I did not turn. I had to lift my straight and useless left
13945	leg for every step. I knew that I had been seriously burned on my back
13946	and side and there were shrapnel wounds elsewhere.
13947	The skimmers whooped and circled but avoided the Temple steps. Gunfire
13948	rattled up and down the Mall. I could hear metal-shod footsteps coming
13949	rapidly behind me. I managed another three steps. Twenty steps above,
13950	impossibly far away, the bishop stood amid a hundred Temple priests.
13951	I made another step and looked down at Johnny. One eye was open,
13952	staring up at me. The other was closed with blood and swollen tissue.
13953	'It's all right,' I whispered, aware for the first time that my own
13954	helmet was gone. 'It's all right. We're almost there." I managed one
13955	more step.
13956	The two men in bright black combat armor blocked my way. Both had
13957	lifted visors streaked with deflection scars and their faces were very
13958	hard.
13959	'Put him down, bitch, and maybe we'll let you live."
13960	I nodded tiredly, too tired to take another step or do anything but
13961	stand there and hold him in both arms.
13962	Johnny's blood dripped on white stone.
13963	'I said, put the son of a bitch down and..."
13964	I shot both of them, one in the left eye and one in the right, never
13965	lifting Dad's automa(ic from where I held it under Johnny's body.
13966	They fell away. I managed another step. And then another. I rested a
13967	bit and then lifted my foot for another.
13968	At the top of the stairs the group of black and red robes parted. The
13969	doorway was very tall and very dark. I did not look back but I could
13970	hear from the noise behind us that the crowd on the Concourse was very
13971	large. The bishop walked by my side as I went through the doors and
13972	into the dimness.
13973	I laid Johnny on the cool floor. Robes rustled around us. I pulled my
13974	own armor off where I could, then batted at Johnny's. It was fused to
13975	his flesh in several places.
13976	I touched his burned cheek with my good hand. 'I'm sorry..."
13977	Johnny's head stirred slightly and his eye opened. He lifted his bare
13978	left hand to touch my cheek, my hair, the back of my head. 'Fanny..."
13979	I felt him die then. I also felt the surge as his hand found the neural
13980	shunt, the white-light warmth of the surge to the Schrn loop as
13981	everything Johnny Keats ever was or would be exploded into me; almost,
13982	almost it was like his orgasm inside me two nights earlier, the surge
13983	and throb and sudden warmth and stillness after, with the echo of
13984	sensation there.
13985	I lowered him to the floor and let the acolytes remove the body, taking
13986	it out to show the crowd and the authorities and the ones who waited to
13987	know.
13988	I let them take me away.
13989	I spent two weeks in a Shrike Temple recovery crche.
13990	Burns healed, scars removed, alien metal extracted, skin grafted, flesh
13991	regrown, nerves rewoven. And still I hurt.
13992	Everyone except the Shrike priests lost interest in me.
13993	The Core made sure that Johnny was dead; that his presence in the Core
13994	had left no trace; that his cybrid was dead.
13995	The authorities took my statement, revoked my license, and covered
13996	things up as best they could. The Web press reported that a battle
13997	between Dregs' Level Hive gangs had erupted onto the Concourse Mail.
13998	Numerous gtng members and innocent bystanders were killed. The police
13999	contained it.
14000	A week before word came that the Hegemony would allow the Yggdrasill to
14001	sail with pilgrims for the war zone near Hyperion, I used a Temple
14002	farcaster to 'cast to Renaissance Vector where I spent an hour alone in
14003	the archives there.
14004	The papers were in vacuum-press so I could not touch them. The
14005	handwriting was Johnny's; I had seen his writing before. The parchment
14006	was yellow and brittle with age. There were two fragments. The first
14007	read:
14008	The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!
14009	Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast, Warm breath,
14010	light whisper, tender semi-tone,
14011	Bright eyes, accomplished shape, and languorous waist.t
14012	Faded the flower and all its budded charms,
14013	Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,
14014	Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,
14015	Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradisem Vanished unseasonably at
14016	shut of eve,
14017	When the dusk holiday - or holinight- Of fragrant-curtained love begins
14018	to weave
14019	The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight;
14020	But, as I've read iove's missal through today,
14021	He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.
14022	The second fragment was in a wilder hand and on rougher paper, as if
14023	slashed across a notepad in haste:
14024	This living hand, now warm and capable
14025	Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
14026	And in the icy silence of the tomb,
14027	So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
14028	That thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood
14029	So in my veins red life might stream again,
14030	And thou be conscience-calm'd - see here it is- I hoM it towards you
14031	I'm pregnant. I think that Johnny knew it. I don't know for sure.
14032	I'm pregnant twice. Once with Johnny's child and once with the
14033	Schr6n-loop memory of what he was. I don't know if the two are meant to
14034	be linked. It will be months before the child is born and only days
14035	before I face the Shrike.
14036	But I remember those minutes after Johnny's torn body was taken out to
14037	the crowd and before I was led away for help. They were all there in
14038	the darkness, hundreds of the priests and acolytes and exorcists and
14039	ostiaries and worshipers... and as one voice they began to chant, there
14040	in that red dimness under the revolving sculpture of the Shrike, and
14041	their voices echoed in Gothic vaults. And what they chanted went
14042	something like this:
14043	'BLESSED BE SHE
14044	BLESSED BE THE MOTHER OF OUR
14045	SALVATION
14046	BLESSED BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR
14047	ATONEMENT
14048	BLESSED BE THE BRIDE OF OUR CREATION BLESSED BE SHE'
14049	I was injured and in shock. I didn't understand it then.
14050	I don't understand it now.
14051	But I know that, when the time arrives and the Shrike comes, Johnny and
14052	I will face it together.
14053	It was long after dark. The tramcar rode between stars and ice. The
14054	group sat in silence, the only sound the creak of cable.
14055	After a time had passed, Lenar Hoyt said to Brawne Lamia, 'You also
14056	carry the cruciform."
14057	Lamia looked at the priest.
14058	Colonel Kassad leaned toward the woman. 'Do you think Het Masteen was
14059	the Templar who had spoken to Johnny?"
14060	'Possibly,' said Brawne Lamia. 'I never found out."
14061	Kassad did not blink. 'Were you the one who killed
14062	Masteen?"
14063	'No."
14064	Martin Silenus stretched and yawned. 'We have a few hours before
14065	sunrise,' he said. 'Anyone else interested in getting some sleep?"
14066	Several heads nodded.
14067	'I'II stay up to keep watch,' said Fedmahn Kassad.
14068	'I'm not tired."
14069	'I'll keep you company,' said the Consul.
14070	'I'll heat some coffee for the therm,' said Brawne Lamia.
14071	When the others slept, the infant Rachel making soft cooing sounds in
14072	her sleep, the other three sat at the windows and watched the stars burn
14073	cold and distant in the high night.
14074	SIX
14075	Chronos Keep jutted from the easternmost rim of the great Bridle Range:
14076	a grim, baroque heap of sweating stones with three hundred rooms and
14077	halls, a maze of lightless corridors leading to deep halls, towers,
14078	turrets, balconies overlooking the northern moors, airshafts rising half
14079	a kilometer to light and rumored to drop to the world's labyrinth
14080	itself, parapets scoured by cold winds from the peaks above, stairways-
14081	inside and out-carved from the mountain stone and leading nowhere,
14082	stained-glass windows a hundred meters tall set to catch the first rays
14083	of solstice sun or the moon on midwinter night, paneless windows the
14084	size of a man's fist looking out on nothing in particular, an endless
14085	array of bas-relief, grotesque sculptures in half-hidden niches, and
14086	more than a thousand gargoyles staring down from eave and parapet,
14087	transept and sepulcher, peering down through wood rafters in the great
14088	halls and positioned so as to peer in the blood-tinted windows of the
14089	northeast face, their winged and hunchbacked shadows moving like grim
14090	sundial hours, cast by sunlight in the day and gas-fed torches at night.
14091	And everywhere in Chronos Keep, signs of the Shrike Church's long
14092	occupation -atonement altars draped in red velvet, hanging and
14093	free-standing sculptures of the Avatar with polychrome steel for blades
14094	and bloodgems for eyes, more statues of the Shrike carved from the stone
14095	of narrow stairways and dark halls so that nowhere in the night would
14096	one be free of the fear of touching hands emerging from rock, the sharp
14097	curve of blade descending from stone, four arms enveloping in a final
14098	embrace. As if in a last measure of ornamentation, a filigree of blood
14099	in many of the once occupied halls and rooms, arabesques
14100	of red spattered in almost recognizable patterns along walls and tunnel
14101	ceilings, bedclothes caked hard with rust-red substance, and a central
14102	dining hall filled with the stench of food rotting from a meal abandoned
14103	weeks earlier, the floor and table, chairs and wall adorned with blood,
14104	stained clothing and shredded robes lying in mute heaps. And everywhere
14105	the sound of flies.
14106	'Jolly fucking place, isn't it?" said Martin Silenus, his voice echoing.
14107	Father Hoyt took several steps deeper into the great hall. Afternoon
14108	light from the west-facing skylight forty meters above fell in dusty
14109	columns. 'It's incredible,' he whispered. 'St Peter's in the New
14110	Vatican is nothing like this."
14111	Martin Silenus laughed. Thick light outlined his cheekbones and satyr's
14112	brows. 'This was built for a living deity,' he said.
14113	Fedmahn Kassad lowered his travel bag to the floor and cleared his
14114	throat. 'Surely this place predates the Shrike Church."
14115	'It does,' said the Consul. 'But they've occupied it for the past two
14116	centuries."
14117	'It doesn't look too occupied now,' said Brawne Lamia. She held her
14118	father's automatic in her left hand.
14119	They had all shouted during their first twenty minutes in the Keep, but
14120	the dying echoes, silences, and buzz of flies in the dining hall had
14121	reduced them to silence.
14122	'Sad King Billy's androids and bond clones built the goddamn thing,'
14123	said the poet. 'Eight local years of labor before the spinships
14124	arrived. It was supposed to be the greatest tourist resort in the Web,
14125	the jumping-off point for the Time Tombs and the City of Poets. But l
14126	suspect that even then the poor schmuck android laborers knew the
14127	locals' version of the Shrike story."
14128	Sol Weintraub stood near an eastern window, holding his daughter up so
14129	that soft light fell across her cheek and curled fist. 'All that
14130	matters little now,' he said. 'Let's find a corner free of carnage
14131	where we can sleep and eat our evening meal."
14132	'Are we going on tonight?" asked Brawne Lamia.
14133	'To the Tombs?" asked Silenus, showing real surprise for the first time
14134	on the voyage. 'You'd go to the Shrike in the dark?"
14135	Lamia shrugged. 'What difference does it make?" The Consul stood near a
14136	leaded glass door leading to a stone balcony and closed his eyes. His
14137	body still lurched and balanced to the movement of the tramcar. The
14138	night and day of travel above the peaks had blurred together in his
14139	mind, lost in the fatigue of almost three days without sleep and his
14140	rising tension. He opened his eyes before he dozed off standing up.
14141	'We're tired,' he said. 'We'll stay here tonight and go down in the
14142	morning."
14143	Father Hoyt had gone out onto the narrow ledge of balcony. He leaned on
14144	a railing of jagged stone. 'Can we see the Tombs from here?"
14145	'No,' said Silenus. 'They're beyond that rise of hills.
14146	But see those white things to the north and west a bit...
14147	those things gleaming like shards of broken teeth in the sand?"
14148	'Yes."
14149	'That's the City of Poets. King Billy's original site for Keats and for
14150	all things bright and beautiful. The locals
14151	say that it's haunted now by headless ghosts."
14152	'Are you one of them?" asked Lamia.
14153	Martin Silenus turned to say something, looked a moment at the pistol
14154	still in her hand, shook his head, and turned away.
14155	Footsteps echoed from an unseen curve of staircase and Colonel Kassad
14156	reentered the room. 'There are two small storerooms above the dining
14157	hall,' he said. 'They have a section of balcony outside but no other
14158	access than this stairway. Easy to defend. The rooms are...
14159	clean. '
14160	Silenus laughed. 'Does that mean nothing can get at us or that, when
14161	something does get at us, we'll have no way to get out?"
14162	'Where would we go?" asked Sol Weintraub.
14163	'Where indeedT' said the Consul. He was very tired.
14164	He lifted his gear and took one handle of the heavy M6bius cube, waiting
14165	for Father Hoyt to lift the other end. 'Let's do what Kassad says. Find
14166	a space to spend
14167	the night. Let's at least get out of this room. It stinks of death."
14168	Dinner was the last of their dried rations, some wine from Silenus's
14169	last bottle, and some stale cake which Sol Weintraub had brought along
14170	to celebrate their last evening together. Rachel was too little to eat
14171	the cake, but she took her milk and went to sleep on her stomach on a
14172	mat near her father.
14173	Lenar Hoyt removed a small balalaika from his pack and strummed a few
14174	chords.
14175	'I didn't know you played,' said Brawne Lamia.
14176	'Poorly."
14177	The Consul rubbed his eyes. 'I wish we had a piano." 'You do have one,'
14178	said Martin Silenus.
14179	The Consul looked at the poet.
14180	'Bring it here,' said Silenus. 'I'd welcome a Scotch."
14181	'What are you talking about?" snapped Father Hoyt.
14182	'Make sense."
14183	'His ship,' said Silenus. 'Do you remember our dear, departed Voice of
14184	the Bush Masteen telling our Consul friend that h/s secret weapon was
14185	that nice Hegemony singleship sitting back at Keats Spaceport? Call it
14186	up, Your Consulship. Bring it on in."
14187	Kassad moved away from the stairway where he had been placing tripbeams.
14188	'The planet's datasphere is dead. The comsats are down. The orbiting
14189	FORCE ships are on tightbeam. How is he supposed to call it?"
14190	It was Lamia who spoke. 'A fatline transmitter." The Consul moved his
14191	stare to her.
14192	'Fatline transmitters are the size of buildings,' said Kassad.
14193	Brawne Lamia shrugged. 'What Masteen said made sense. If I were the
14194	Consul... if I were one of the few thousand individuals in the entire
14195	damn Web to own a singleship . . . I'd be damn sure I could fly it in
14196	on remote if I needed it. The planet's too primitive to depend on its
14197	comm net, the ionosphere's too weak for shortwave, the comsats are the
14198	first things to go in a skirmish... I'd call it by fatline."
14199	'And the size?" said the Consul.
14200	Brawne Lamia returned the diplomat's level gaze.
14201	'The Hegemony can't yet build portable fatline transmitters.
14202	There are rumors that the Ousters can."
14203	The Consul smiled. From somewhere there came a scrape and then the
14204	sound of metal crashing.
14205	'Stay here,' said Kassad. He removed a deathwand from his tunic,
14206	canceled the tripbeams with his tactical comlog, and descended from
14207	sight.
14208	'I guess we're under martial law now,' said Silenus
14209	when the Colonel was gone. 'Mars ascendant."
14210	'Shut up,' said Lamia.
14211	'Do you think it's the Shrike?" asked Hoyt.
14212	The Consul made a gesture. 'The Shrike doesn't have to clank around
14213	downstairs. It can simply appear...
14214	here."
14215	Hoyt shook his head. 'I mean the Shrike that has been the cause of
14216	everyone's... absence. The signs of slaughter here in the Keep."
14217	'The empty villages might be the result of the evacuation order,' said
14218	the Consul. 'No one wants to stay behind to face the Ousters. The SDF
14219	forces have been running wild. Much of the carnage could be their
14220	doing."
14221	'With no bodies?" laughed Martin Silenus. 'Wishful thinking. Our
14222	absent hosts downstairs dangle now on the
14223	Shrike's steel tree. Where, ere long, we too will be." 'Shut up,'
14224	Brawne Lamia said tiredly.
14225	'And if I don't,' grinned the poet, 'will you shoot me,
14226	madam?"
14227	'Yes."
14228	The silence lasted until Colonel Kassad returned. He reactivated the
14229	tripbeams and turned to the group seated on packing crates and flowfoam
14230	cubes. 'It was nothing.
14231	Some carrion birds - harbingers, I think the locals call them - had come
14232	in through the broken glass doors in the dining hall and were finishing
14233	the feast."
14234	Silenus chuckled. 'Harbingers. Very appropriate." Kassad sighed, sat
14235	on a blanket with his back to a crate, and poked at his cold food. A
14236	single lantern brought from the windwagon lighted the room and the
14237	shadows were beginning to mount the walls in the corners away from the
14238	door to the balcony. 'It's our last
14239	night,' said Kassad. 'One more story to tell." He looked at the Consul.
14240	The Consul had been twisting his slip of paper with the number 7
14241	scrawled on it. He licked his lips. 'What's the purpose? The purpose
14242	of the pilgrimage has been destroyed already."
14243	The others stirred.
14244	'What do you mean?" asked Father Hoyt.
14245	The Consul crumpled the paper and threw it into a corner. 'For the
14246	Shrike to grant a request, the band of pilgrims must constitute a prime
14247	number. We had seven.
14248	Masteen's ... disappearance ... reduces us to six.
14249	We go to our deaths now with no hope of a wish being granted."
14250	'Superstition,' said Lamia.
14251	The Consul sighed and rubbed his brow. 'Yes. But that is our final
14252	hope."
14253	Father Hoyt gestured toward the sleeping infant.
14254	'Can't Rachel be our seventh?"
14255	Sol Weintraub rubbed his beard. 'No. A pilgrim must come to the Tombs
14256	of his or her own free will."
14257	'But she did once,' said Hoyt. 'Maybe it qualifies." 'No,' said the
14258	Consul.
14259	Martin Silenus had been writing notes on a pad but now he stood and
14260	paced the length of the room. 'Jesus Christ, people. Look at us. We're
14261	not six fucking pilgrims, we're a mob. Hoyt there with his cruciform
14262	carrying the ghost of Paul Dur6. Our "semisentient" erg in the box
14263	there. Colonel Kassad with his memory of Moneta. M. Brawne there, if
14264	we are to believe her tale, carrying not only an unborn child but a dead
14265	Romantic poet. Our scholar with the child his daughter used to be.
14266	Me with my muse. The Consul with whatever fucking baggage he's brought
14267	to this insane trek. My God, people, we should have received a fucking
14268	group rate for this trip."
14269	'Sit down,' said Lamia in a dead even tone.
14270	'No, he's right,' said Hoyt. 'Even the presence of Father Dur6 in
14271	cruciform must affect the prime-number superstition somehow. I say that
14272	we press on in the morning in the belief that..."
14273	'Look!" cried Brawne Lamia, pointing to the balcony doorway where the
14274	fading twilight had been replaced with pulses of strong light.
14275	The group went out into the cool evening air, shielding their eyes from
14276	the staggering display of silent explosions which filled the sky: pure
14277	white fusion bursts expanding like explosive ripples across a lapis
14278	pond; smaller, brighter plasma implosions in blue and yellow and
14279	brightest red, curling inward like flowers folding for the night: the
14280	lightning dance of gigantic heliwhip displays, beams the size of small
14281	worlds cutting their swath across light-hours and being contorted by the
14282	riptides of defensive singularities: the aurora shimmer of defense
14283	fields leaping and dying under the assault of terrible energies only to
14284	be reborn nanoseconds later. Amid it all, the blue-white fusion tails
14285	of torchships and larger warships slicing perfectly true lines across
14286	the sky like diamond scratches on blue glass.
14287	'The Ousters,' breathed Brawne Lamia.
14288	'The war's begun,' said Kassad. There was no elation in his voice, no
14289	emotion of any kind.
14290	The Consul was shocked to discover that he was weeping silently. He
14291	turned his face from the group.
14292	'Are we in danger here?" asked Martin Silenus. He sheltered under the
14293	stone'archway of the door, squinting at the brilliant display.
14294	'Not at this distance,' said Kassad. He raised his combat binoculars,
14295	made an adjustment, and consulted his tactical tomlog. 'Most of the
14296	engagements are at least three AU away. The Ousters are testing the
14297	FORCE:space defenses." He lowered the glasses. 'It's just begun."
14298	'Has the farcaster been activated yet?" asked Brawne Lamia. 'Are the
14299	people being evacuated from Keats and the other cities?"
14300	Kassad shook his head. 'I don't believe so. Not yet.
14301	The fleet will be fighting a holding action until the cislunar sphere is
14302	completed. Then the evacuation portals will be opened to the Web while
14303	FORCE units come through by the hundreds." He raised the binoculars
14304	again. 'It'll be a hell of a show."
14305	'Look!" It was Father Hoyt pointing this time, not at the fireworks
14306	display in the sky but out across the low dunes of the northern moors.
14307	Several kilometers toward the unseen Tombs, a single figure was just
14308	visible as a speck of a form throwing multiple shadows under the
14309	fractured sky.
14310	Kassad trained his glasses on the figure.
14311	'The Shrike?" asked Lamia.
14312	'No, I don't think so... I think it's... a Templar by the looks of the
14313	robe."
14314	'Het Masteen!" cried Father Hoyt.
14315	Kassad shrugged and handed the glasses around. The Consul walked back
14316	to the group and leaned on the balcony.
14317	There was no sound but the whisper of wind, but that made the violence
14318	of explosions above them more ominous somehow.
14319	The Consul took his turn looking when the glasses came to him. The
14320	figure was tall and robed, its back to the Keep, and strode across the
14321	flashing vermilion sands with purposeful intent.
14322	'Is he headed toward us or the Tombs?" asked Lamia.
14323	'The Tombs,' said the Consul.
14324	Father Hoyt leaned elbows on the ledge and raised his gaunt face to the
14325	exploding sky. 'If it is Masteen, then we're back to seven, aren't we?"
14326	'He'll arrive hours before us,' said the Consul. 'Half a day if we
14327	sleep here tonight as we proposed."
14328	Hoyt shrugged. 'That can't matter too much. Seven set out on the
14329	pilgrimage. Seven will arrive. The Shrike will be satisfied."
14330	'If it/s Masteen,' said Colonel Kassad, 'why the charade on the
14331	windwagon? And how did he get here before us? There were no other
14332	tramcars running and he couldn't have walked over the Bridle Range
14333	passes."
14334	'We'll ask him when we arrive at the Tombs tomorrow,' Father Hoyt said
14335	tiredly.
14336	Brawne Lamia had been trying to raise someone on her comlog's general
14337	comm frequencies. Nothing emerged but the hiss of static and the
14338	occasional growl of distant EMPs. She looked at Colonel Kassad. 'When
14339	do they start bombing?"
14340	'I don't know. It depends uporr the strength of the FORCE fleet
14341	defenses."
14342	'The defenses weren't very good the other day when the Ouster scouts got
14343	through and destroyed the
14344	Yggdrasi!i,' said Lamia.
14345	Kassad nodded.
14346	'Hey,' said Martin Silenus, 'are we sitting on a fucking target?"
14347	'Of course,' said the Consul. 'If the Ousters are attacking Hyperion to
14348	prevent the opening of the Time Tombs, as M. Lamia's tale suggests,
14349	then the Tombs and this entire area would be a primary target."
14350	'For nukes?" asked Silenus, his voice strained.
14351	'Almost certainly,' answered Kassad.
14352	'I thought something about the anti-entropic fields kept ships away from
14353	here,' said Father Hoyt.
14354	'Crewed ships,' said the Consul without looking back at the others from
14355	where he leaned on the railing. 'The anti-entropic fields won't bother
14356	guided missiles, smart bombs, or hellwhip beams. It won't bother mech
14357	infantry, for that matter. The Ousters could land a few attack skimmers
14358	or automated tanks and watch on remote while they destroy the valley."
14359	'But they won't,' said Brawne Lamia. 'They want to control Hyperion,
14360	not destroy it."
14361	'I wouldn't wager my life on that supposition,' said Kassad.
14362	Lamia smiled at him, 'But we are, aren't we, Colonel?"
14363	Above them, a single spark separated itself from the continuous
14364	patchwork of explosions, grew into a bright orange ember, and streaked
14365	across the sky. The group on the terrace could see the flames, hear the
14366	tortured shriek of atmospheric penetration. The fireball disappeared
14367	beyond the mountains behind the Keep.
14368	Almost a minute later, the Consul realized that he had been holding his
14369	breath, his hands rigid on the stone railing. He let out air in a gasp.
14370	The others seemed to be taking a breath at the same moment. There had
14371	been no explosion, no shock wave rumbling through the rock.
14372	'A dud?" asked Father Hoyt.
14373	'Probably an injured FORCE skirmisher trying to reach the orbital
14374	perimeter or the spaceport at Keats,' said Colonel Kassad.
14375	'He didn't make it, did he?" asked Lamia. Kassad did not respond.
14376	Martin Silenus lifted the field glasses and searched the darkening moors
14377	for the Templar. 'Out of sight,' said Silenus. 'The good Captain
14378	either rounded that hill just this side of the Time Tombs valley or he
14379	pulled his disappearing act again."
14380	'It's a pity that we'll never hear his story,' said Father Hoyt. He
14381	turned toward the Consul. 'But we'll hear yours, won't we?"
14382	The Consul rubbed his palms against his pant legs. His heart was
14383	racing. 'Yes,' he said, realizing even as he spoke that he had finally
14384	made up his mind. 'I'II tell mine."
14385	The wind roared down the east slopes of the mountains and whistled along
14386	the escarpment of Chronos Keep. The explosions above them seemed to
14387	have diminished ever so slightly, but the coming of darkness made each
14388	one look even more violent than the last.
14389	'Let's go inside,' said Lamia, her words almost lost in the wind sound.
14390	'It's getting cold."
14391	They had turned off the single lamp and the interior of the room was
14392	lighted only by the heat-lightning pulses of color from the sky outside.
14393	Shadows sprang into being, vanished, and appeared again as the room was
14394	painted in many colors. Sometimes the darkness would last several
14395	seconds before the next barrage.
14396	The Consul reached into his traveling bag and took out a strange device,
14397	larger than a comlog, oddly orna-mented, and fronted with a liquid
14398	crystal diskey like something out of a history holo.
14399	'Secret fatline transmitter?" Brawne Lamia asked dryly.
14400	The Consul's smile showed no humor. 'It's an ancient comlog. It came
14401	out during the Hegira." He removed a standard micro-disk from a pouch on
14402	his belt and inserted it. 'Like Father Hoyt, I have someone else's tale
14403	to tell before you can understand my own."
14404	'Christ on a stick,' sneered Martin Silenus, 'am I the only one who can
14405	tell a straightforward story in this fucking herd? How long do I have
14406	to..."
14407	The Consui's movement surprised even himself. He rose, spun, caught the
14408	smaller man by the cape and shirt-front, slammed him against the wail,
14409	draped him over a packing crate with a knee in Silenus's belly and a
14410	forearm against his throat, and hissed, 'One more word from you, poet,
14411	and I'll kill you."
14412	Silenus began to struggle but a tightening on his windpipe and a glance
14413	at the Consul's eyes made him cease.
14414	His face was very white.
14415	Colonel Kassad silently, almost gently, separated the two. 'There will
14416	be no more comments,' he said. He touched the deathwand in his belt.
14417	Martin Silenus went to the far side of the circle, still rubbing his
14418	throat, and slumped against a crate without a word. The Consul strode
14419	to the door, took several deep breaths, and walked back to the group. He
14420	spoke to everyone but the poet. 'l'm sorry. It is just that . . . I
14421	never expected to share this."
14422	The light from outside surged red and then white, followed by a blue
14423	glow which faded to near darkness.
14424	'We know,' Brawne Lamia said softly. 'We all felt that way."
14425	The Consul touched his lower lip, nodded, roughly cleared his throat,
14426	and came to sit by the ancient comlog.
14427	'The recording is not as old as the instrument,' he said.
14428	'It was made about fifty standard years ago. I'll have some more to say
14429	when it's over." He paused as if there were more to be said, shook his
14430	head, and thumbed the antique diskey.
14431	There were no visuals. The voice was that of a young man. In the
14432	background one could hear a breeze blowing through grass or soft
14433	branches and, more distantly, the roll of surf.
14434	Outside, the light pulsed madly as the tempo of the distant space battle
14435	quickened. The Consul tensed as he waited for the crash and concussion.
14436	There was none. He closed his eyes and listened with the others.
14437	THE CONSUL'S TALE: Remembering Siri
14438	I climb the steep hill to Siri's tomb on the day the islands return to
14439	the shallow seas of the Equatorial Archipelago.
14440	The day is perfect and I hate it for being so. The sky is as tranquil
14441	as tales of Old Earth's seas, the shallows are dappled with ultramarine
14442	tints, and a warm breeze blows in from the sea to ripple the russet
14443	willowgrass on the hillside near me.
14444	Better low clouds and gray gloom on such a day. Better mist or a
14445	shrouding fog which sets the masts in First-site Harbor dripping and
14446	raises the lighthouse horn from its slumbers. Better one of the great
14447	sea-simoons blowing up out of the cold belly of the south, lashing
14448	before it the motile isles and their dolphin herders until they seek
14449	refuge in the lee of our atolls and stony peaks.
14450	Anything would be better than this warm spring day when the sun moves
14451	through a vault of sky so blue that it makes me want to run, to jump in
14452	great loping arcs, and to roll in the soft grass as Siri and I have done
14453	at just this spot.
14454	Just this spot. I pause to look around. The willowgrass bends and
14455	ripples like the fur of some great beast as the salt-tinged breeze gusts
14456	up out of the south. I shield my eyes and search the horizon but
14457	nothing moves there.
14458	Out beyond the lava reef, the sea begins to chop and lift itself in
14459	nervous strokes.
14460	'Siri,' I whisper. I say her name without meaning to do so. A hundred
14461	meters down the slope, the crowd pauses to watch me and to catch its
14462	collective breath. The procession of mourners and celebrants stretches
14463	for more than a kilometer to where the white buildings of the city
14464	begin. I can make out the gray and balding head of my younger son in
14465	the vanguard. He is wearing the blue and gold robes of the Hegemony. I
14466	know that I should wait for him, walk with him, but he and the other
14467	aging Council members cannot keep up with my young, ship-trained muscles
14468	and steady stride. But decorum dictates that I should walk with him and
14469	my granddaughter Lira and my nine-year-old grandson.
14470	To hell with it. And to hell with them.
14471	I turn and jog up the steep hillside. Sweat begins to soak my loose
14472	cotton shirt before I reach the curving
14473	summit of the ridge and catch sight of the tomb.
14474	Siri' s tomb.
14475	I stop. The wind chills me although the sunlight is warm enough as it
14476	glints off the flawless white stone of the silent mausoleum. The grass
14477	is high near the sealed entrance to the crypt. Rows of faded festival
14478	pennants on ebony staffs line the narrow gravel path.
14479	Hesitating, I circle the tomb and approach the steep cliff edge a few
14480	meters beyond. The willowgrass is bent and trampled here where
14481	irreverent picnickers have laid their blankets. There are several fire
14482	rings formed from the perfectly round, perfectly white stones purloined
14483	from the border of the gravel path.
14484	I cannot stop a smile. I know the view from here: the great curve of
14485	the outer harbor with its natural seawall, the low, white buildings of
14486	Firstsite, and the colorful hulls and masts of the catamarans bobbing at
14487	anchorage.
14488	Near the pebble beach beyond Common Hall, a young woman in a white skirt
14489	moves toward the water. For a second I think that it is Siri and my
14490	heart pounds. I half prepare to throw up my arms in response to her
14491	wave but she does not wave. I watch in silence as the distant figure
14492	turns away and is lost in the shadows of the old boat building.
14493	Above me, far out from the cliff, a wide-winged Thomas Hawk circles
14494	above the lagoon on rising thermals and scans the shifting bluekelp beds
14495	with its infrared vision, seeking out harp seals or torpids. Nature hv
14496	stupid, I think and sit in the soft grass. Nature sets the stage all
14497	wrong for such a day and then it is insensitive enough to throw in a
14498	bird searching for prey which have long since fled the polluted waters
14499	near the growing city.
14500	I remember another Thomas Hawk on that first night when Siri and I came
14501	to this hilltop. I remember the moonlight on its wings and the strange,
14502	haunting cry
14503	which echoed off the cliff and seemed to pierce the dark air above the
14504	gaslights of the village below.
14505	Siri was sixteen... no, not quite sixteen... and the moonlight that
14506	touched the hawk's wings above us also painted her bare skin with milky
14507	light and cast shadows beneath the soft circles of her breasts. We
14508	looked up guiltily when the bird's cry cut the night and Siri said, '
14509	"It was the nightingale and not the lark, That pierc'd the fearful
14510	hollow of thine ear." '
14511	'Huh?" I said. Siri was almost sixteen. I was nineteen.
14512	But Siri knew the slow pace of books and the cadences of theater under
14513	the stars. I knew only the stars.
14514	'Relax, young Shipman,' she whispered and pulled me down beside her
14515	then. 'It's only an old Tom's Hawk hunting. Stupid bird. Come back,
14516	Shipman. Come back, Merin."
14517	The Los Angeles had chosen that moment to rise above the horizon and to
14518	float like a wind-borne ember west across the strange constellations of
14519	Maui-Covenant, Siri's world. I lay next to her and described the
14520	workings of the great Hawking-drive spinship which was catching the high
14521	sunlight against the drop of night above us, and all the while my hand
14522	was sliding lower along her smooth side, her skin seemed all velvet and
14523	electricity, and her breath came more quickly against my shoulder. I
14524	lowered my face to the hollow of her neck, to the sweat and perfume
14525	essence of her tousled hair.
14526	'Siri,' I say and this time her name is not unbidden.
14527	Below me, below the crest of the hill and the shadow of the white tomb,
14528	the crowd stands and shuffles. They are impatient with me. They want
14529	me to unseal the tomb, to enter, and to have my private moment in the
14530	cool silent emptiness that has replaced the warm presence that was Siri.
14531	They want me to say my farewells so they can get on with their rites and
14532	rituals, open the farcaster doors, and
14533	join the waiting Worldweb of the Hegemony.
14534	To hell with that. And to hell with them.
14535	I pull up a tendril of the thickly woven willowgrass, chew on the sweet
14536	stem, and watch the horizon for the first sign of the migrating islands.
14537	The shadows are still
14538	long in the morning light. The day is young. I will sit here for a
14539	while and remember.
14540	I will remember Siri.
14541	Siri was a... what?... a bird, I think, the first time I saw her. She
14542	was wearing some sort of mask with bright feathers. When she removed it
14543	to join in the raceme quadrille, the torchlight caught the deep auburn
14544	tints of her hair. She was flushed, cheeks aflame, and even from across
14545	the crowded common I could see the startling green of her eyes
14546	contrasting with the summer heat of her face and hair. It was Festival
14547	Night, of course. The torches danced and sparked to the stiff breeze
14548	coming in off the harbor and the sound of the flutists on the break-wall
14549	playing for the passing isles was almost drowned out by surf sounds and
14550	the crack of pennants snapping in the wind. Siri was almost sixteen and
14551	her beauty burned more brightly than any of the torches set round the
14552	throng-filled square. I pushed through the dancing crowd and went to
14553	her.
14554	It was five years ago for me. It was more than sixty five years ago for
14555	us. It seems only yesterday.
14556	This is not going well.
14557	Where to start?
14558	'What say we go find a little nooky, kid?" Mike Osho was speaking.
14559	Short, squat, his pudgy face a clever caricature of a Buddha, Mike was a
14560	god to me then. We were all gods; long-lived if not immortal, well paid
14561	if not quite divine. The Hegemony had chosen us to help crew one of its
14562	precious quantum-leap spinships, so how could we be less than gods? It
14563	was just that Mike, brilliant, mercurial, irreverent Mike, was a little
14564	older and a little higher in the Shipboard pantheon than young Merin
14565	Aspic.
14566	'Hah. Zero probability of that,' I said. We were scrubbing up after a
14567	twelve-hour shift with the farcaster construction crew. Shuttling the
14568	workers around their chosen singularity point some one hundred and
14569	sixty-three thousand kilometers out from Maul-Covenant was a lot less
14570	glamorous for us than the four-month leap from Hegemony-space. During
14571	the C-plus portion of the
14572	trip we had been master specialists; forty-nine starship experts
14573	shepherding some two hundred nervous passengers.
14574	Now the passengers had their hardsuits on and we Shipmen had been
14575	reduced to serving as glorified truck drivers as the construction crew
14576	wrestled the bulky singularity containment sphere into place.
14577	'Zero probability,' I repeated. 'Unless the groundlings have added a
14578	whorehouse to that quarantine island they leased us."
14579	'Nope. They haven't,' grinned Mike. He and I had our three days of
14580	planetary R and R coming up but we knew from Shipmaster Singh's
14581	briefings and the moans of our Shipmates that the only ground time we
14582	had to look forward to would be spent on a seven-by-four-kilometer
14583	island administered by the Hegemony. It wasn't even one of the motile
14584	isles we had heard about, just another volcanic peak near the equator.
14585	Once there, we could i:ount on real gravity underfoot, unfiltered air to
14586	breathe, and the chance to taste unsynthesized food. But we could also
14587	count on the fact that the only intercourse we would have with the
14588	Maul-Covenant colonists would be through buying local artifacts at the
14589	duty-free store.
14590	Even those were sold by Hegemony trade specialists.
14591	Many of our Shipmates had chosen to spend their R and R on the Los
14592	Angeles.
14593	'So how do we find a little nooky, Mike? The colonies are off limits
14594	until the farcaster's working. That's about sixty years away, local
14595	time. Or are you talking about Meg in spincomp?"
14596	'Stick with me, kid,' said Mike. 'Where there's a will, there's a way."
14597	I stuck with Mike. There were only five of us in the dropship. It was
14598	always a thrill to me to fall out of high orbit into the atmosphere of a
14599	real world. Especially a world that looked as much like Old Earth as
14600	Maul-Covenant did. I stared at the blue and white limb of the planet
14601	until the seas were down and we were in atmosphere, approaching the
14602	twilight terminator in a gentle glide at three times the speed of our
14603	own sound.
14604	We were gods then. But even gods must descend from their high thrones
14605	upon occasion.
14606	AAA
14607	Siri's body never ceased to amaze me. That time on the Archipelago.
14608	Three weeks in that huge, swaying tree-house under the billowing
14609	treesails with the dolphin herders keeping pace like outriders, tropical
14610	sunsets filling the evening with wonder, the canopy of stars at night,
14611	and our own wake marked by a thousand phosphorescent swirls that
14612	mirrored the constellations above. And still it is Siri's body I
14613	remember. For some reason-shyness, the years of separation - she wore
14614	two strips of swimsuit for the first few days of our Archipelago stay
14615	and the soft white of her breasts and lower belly had not darkened to
14616	match the rest of her tan before I had to leave again.
14617	I remember her that first time. Triangles in the moonlight as we lay in
14618	the soft grass above Firstsite Harbor.
14619	Her silk pants catching on a weave of willowgrass. There was a child's
14620	modesty then; the slight hesitation of something given prematurely. But
14621	also pride. The same pride that later allowed her to face down the
14622	angry mob of Separatists on the steps of the Hegemony consulate in South
14623	Tern and send them to their homes in shame.
14624	I remember my fifth planetfall, our Fourth Reunion.
14625	It was one of the few times I ever saw her cry. She was almost regal in
14626	her fame and wisdom by then. She had been elected four times to the All
14627	Thing and the Hegemony Council turned to her for advice and guidance.
14628	She wore her independence like a royal cloak and her fierce pride had
14629	never burned more brightly. But when we were alone in the stone villa
14630	south of Fevarone, it was she who turned away. I was nervous,
14631	frightened by this powerful stranger, but it was $iri- Siri of the
14632	straight back and proud eyes, who turned her face to the wall and said
14633	through tears, 'Go away. Go away, Merin.
14634	I don't want you to see me. I'm a crone, all slack and sagging. Go
14635	away."
14636	I confess that I was rough with her then. I pinned her wrists with my
14637	left hand - using a strength which surprised even me - and tore her
14638	silken robe down the front in one move. I kissed her shoulders, her
14639	neck, the faded shadows of stretch marks on her taut belly, and the scar
14640	on her upper leg from the skimmer crash some forty of her years earlier.
14641	I kissed her graying hair and the lines etched in the once smooth
14642	cheeks. I kissed her tears.
14643	'Jesus, Mike, this can't be legal,' I'd said when my friend unrolled the
14644	hawking mat from his backpack. We were on island 24I, as the Hegemony
14645	traders had so romantically named the desolate volcanic blemish which
14646	they had chosen for our R and R site. Island 24I was less than fifty
14647	kilometers from the oldest of the colonial settlements but it might as
14648	well have been fifty light-years away. No native ships were to put in
14649	at the island while Los Angeles crewmen or farcaster workmen were
14650	present.
14651	The Maul-Covenant colonists had a few ancient skimmers still in working
14652	order, but by mutual agreement there would be no overflights. Except
14653	for the dormitories, swimming beach, and the duty-free store, there was
14654	little on the island to interest us Shipmen.
14655	Someday, when the last components had been brought in-system by the Los
14656	Angeles and the farcaster finished, Hegemony officials would make island
14657	24I into a center for trade and tourism. Until then it was a primitive
14658	place with a dropship grid, newly finished buildings of the local white
14659	stone, and a few bored maintenance people.
14660	Mike checked the two of us out for three days of backpacking on the
14661	steepest and most inaccessible end of the little island.
14662	'I don't want to go backpacking, for Chrissake,' I'd said. 'I'd rather
14663	stay on the L.A. and plug into a stimsim."
14664	'Shut up and follow me,' said Mike and, like a lesser member of the
14665	pantheon following an older and wiser deity, I had shut up and followed.
14666	Two hours of heavy tramping up the slopes through sharp-branched
14667	scrubtrees brought us to a lip of lava several hundred meters above the
14668	crashing surf. We were near the equator on a mostly tropical world but
14669	on this exposed ledge the wind was howling and my teeth were chattering.
14670	The sunset was a red smear between dark cumulus to the west and ! had
14671	no wish to be out in the open when full night descended.
14672	'Come on,' I said. 'Let's get out of the wind and build a fire. I
14673	don't know how the hell we're going to set up a tent on all of this
14674	rock."
14675	Mike sat down and lit a cannabis stick. 'Take a look in your pack,
14676	kid."
14677	I hesitated. His voice had been neutral but it was the flat neutrality
14678	of the practical joker's voice just before the bucket of water descends.
14679	I crouched down and began pawing through the nylon sack. The pack was
14680	empty except for old flowfoam packing cubes to fill it out. Those and a
14681	Harlequin's costume complete with mask and bells on the toes.
14682	'Are you... is this... are you goddamn crazy?" I spluttered. It was
14683	getting dark quickly now. The storm might or might not pass to the
14684	south of us. The surf was rasping below like a hungry beast. If I had
14685	known how to find my own way back to .the trade compound in the dark, I
14686	might have considered leaving Mike Osho's remains to feed the fishes far
14687	below.
14688	'Now look at what's in my pack,' he said. Mike dumped out some flowfoam
14689	cubes and then removed some jewelry of the type I'd seen handcrafted on
14690	Renaissance Vector, an inertial compass, a laser pen which might or
14691	might not be labeled a concealed weapon by ShipSecurity, another
14692	Harlequin costume - this one tailored to his more rotund form ' and a
14693	hawking mat.
14694	'Jesus, Mike,' I said while running my hand over the exquisite design of
14695	the old carpet, 'this can't be legal."
14696	'I didn't notice any customs agents back there,' grinned Mike. 'And I
14697	seriously doubt that the locals have any traffic control ordinances."
14698	'Yes, but..." I trailed off and unrolled the rest of the mat. It was a
14699	little more than a meter wide and about two meters long. The rich
14700	fabric had faded with age but the flight threads were still as bright as
14701	new copper. 'Where did you get it?" I asked. 'Does it still work?"
14702	'On Garden,' said Mike and stuffed my costume and his other gear into
14703	his backpack. 'Yes, it does."
14704	It had been more than a century since old Vladimir Sholokov, Old Earth
14705	emigrant, master lepidopterist, and EM systems engineer, had handcrafted
14706	the first
14707	hawking mat for his beautiful young niece on New Earth. Legend had it
14708	that the niece had scorned the gift but over the decades the toys had
14709	become almost absurdly popular - more with rich adults than with
14710	childrenuntil they were outlawed on most Hegemony worlds. Dangerous to
14711	handle, a waste of shielded monofilaments, almost impossible to deal
14712	with in controlled airspace, hawking mats had become curiosities
14713	reserved for bedtime stories, museums, and a few colony worlds.
14714	'It must have cost you a fortune,' I said.
14715	'Thirty marks,' said Mike and settled himself on the center of the
14716	carpet. 'The old dealer in Carvnel Marketplace thought it was
14717	worthless. It was . . . for him. I brought it back to the ship,
14718	charged it up, reprogrammed the inertia chips, and voild!" Mike palmed
14719	the intricate design and the mat stiffened and rose fifteen centimeters
14720	above the rock ledge.
14721	I stared doubtfully. 'All right,' I said, 'but what if it..."
14722	'It won't,' said Mike and impatiently patted the carpet behind him.
14723	'It's fully charged. I know how to handle it.
14724	Come on, climb on or stand back. I want to get going
14725	before that storm gets any closer."
14726	'But I don't think..."
14727	'Come on, Merin. Make up your mind. I'm in a hurry."
14728	I hesitated for another second or two. If we were caught leaving the
14729	island, we would both be kicked off the ship. Shipwork was my life now.
14730	I had made that decision when I accepted the eight-mission Maui-Covenant
14731	contract. More than that, I was two hundred light-years and five and a
14732	half leap years from civilization.
14733	Even if they brought us back to Hegemony-space, the round trip would
14734	have cost us eleven years' worth of friends and family. The time-debt
14735	was irrevocable.
14736	I crawled on the hovering hawking mat behind Mike.
14737	He stuffed the backpack between us, told me to hang on, and tapped at
14738	the flight designs. The mat rose five meters above the ledge, banked
14739	quickly to the left, and shot out over the alien ocean. Three hundred
14740	meters below us, the
14741	surf crashed whitely in the deepening gloom. We rose higher above the
14742	rough water and headed north into the night.
14743	In such seconds of decision entire futures arc made.
14744	I remember talking to Siri during our Second Reunion, shortly after we
14745	first visited the villa along the coast near Fevarone. We were walking
14746	along the beach. AI6n had been allowed to stay in the city under
14747	Magritte's supervision.
14748	It was just as well. I was not truly comfortable with the boy. Only
14749	the undeniable green solemnity of his eyes and the disturbing
14750	mirror-familiarity of his short, dark curls and snub of a nose served to
14751	tie him to me... to us . . . in my mind. That and the quick, almost
14752	sardonic smile I would catch him hiding from Siri when she reprimanded
14753	him. It was a smile too cynically amused and self-observant to be so
14754	practiced in a ten-year-old. I knew it well. I would have thought such
14755	things were learned, not inherited.
14756	'You know very little,' Siri said to me. She was wading, shoeless, in a
14757	shallow tidepool. From time to time she would lift the delicate shell
14758	of a frenchhorn conch, inspect it for flaws, and drop it back into the
14759	silty water.
14760	Tve been well trained,' I replied.
14761	'Yes, I'm sure you've been well trained,' agreed Siri. 'I know you are
14762	quite skillful, Merin. But you know very little."
14763	Irritated, unsure of how to respond, I walked along with my head
14764	lowered. I dug a white lavastone out of the sand and tossed it far out
14765	into the bay. Rain clouds were piling along the eastern horizon. I
14766	found myself wishing that I was back aboard the ship. I had been
14767	reluctant to return this time and now I knew that it had been a mistake.
14768	It was my third visit to Maui-Covenant, our Second Reunion as the poets
14769	and her people were calling it. I was five months away from being
14770	twenty-one standard years old. Siri had just celebrated her
14771	thirty-seventh birthday three weeks earlier.
14772	'I've been to a lot of places you've never seen,' I said at last. It
14773	sounded petulant and childish even to me.
14774	'Oh, yes,' said Siri and clapped her hands together.
14775	For a second, in her enthusiasm, I glimpsed my other Siri -the young
14776	girl I had dreamed about during the long nine.months of turnaround. Then
14777	the image slid back to harsh reality and I was all too aware of her
14778	short hair, the loosening neck muscles, and the cords appearing on the
14779	backs of those once beloved hands.
14780	'You've been to places I'll never see,' said Siri in a rush.
14781	Her voice was the same. Almost the same. 'Merin, my love, you've
14782	already seen things I cannot even imagine.
14783	You probably know more facts about the universe than I would guess
14784	exist. But you know very little, my darling."
14785	'What the hell are you talking about, Siri?" I sat down on a
14786	half-submerged log near the strip of wet sand and drew my knees up like
14787	a fence between us.
14788	Siri strode out of the tidepool and came to kneel in front of me. She
14789	took my hands in hers and, although mine were bigger, heavier, bluntcr
14790	of finger and bone, I could feel the strength in hers. I imagined it as
14791	the strength of years I had not shared. 'You have to live to really
14792	know things, my love. Having AI6n has helped me to understand that.
14793	There is something about raising a
14794	child that helps to sharpen one's sense of what is real." 'How do you
14795	mean?"
14796	Siri squinted away from me for a few seconds and absently brushed back a
14797	strand of hair. Her left hand stayed firmly around both of mine. 'I'm
14798	not sure,' she said softly. 'I think one begins to feel when things
14799	aren't important. I'm not sure how to put it. When you've spent thirty
14800	years entering rooms filled with strangers you feel less pressure than
14801	when you've had only half that number of years of experience. You know
14802	what the room and the people in it probably hold for you and you go
14803	looking for it. If it's not there, you sense it earlier and leave to go
14804	about your business. You just know more about what is, what isn't, and
14805	how little time there is to learn the difference. Do you understand,
14806	Merin? Do you
14807	follow me even a little bit?"
14808	'No,' I said.
14809	Siri nodded and bit her lower lip. But she did not speak again for a
14810	while. Instead, she leaned over and kissed me.
14811	Her lips were dry and a little questioning. I held back for a second,
14812	seeing the sky beyond her, wanting time to think. But then I felt the
14813	warm intrusion of her tongue and closed my eyes. The tide was coming in
14814	behind us. I felt a sympathetic warmth and rising as Siri unbuttoned my
14815	shirt and ran sharp fingernails across my chest. There was a second of
14816	emptiness between us and I opened my eyes in time to see her unfastening
14817	the last buttons on the front of her white dress. Her breasts were
14818	larger than I remembered, heavier, the nipples broader and darker.
14819	The chill air nipped at both of us until I pulled the fabric down her
14820	shoulders and brought our upper bodies together. We slid down along the
14821	log to the warm sand. I pressed her closer, all the While wondering how
14822	I possibly could have thought her the stronger one. Her skin tasted of
14823	salt.
14824	Siri's hands helped me. Her short hair pressed back against bleached
14825	wood, white cotton, and sand. My pulse outraced the surf.
14826	'Do you understand, Merin?" she whispered to me seconds later as her
14827	warmth connected us.
14828	'Yes,' I whispered back. But I did not.
14829	Mike brought the hawking mat in from the east toward Firstsite. The
14830	flight had taken over an hour in the dark and I had spent most of the
14831	time huddling from the wind and waiting for the carpet to fold up and
14832	tumble us both into the sea. We were still half an hour out when we saw
14833	the first of the motile isles. Racing before the storm, treesails
14834	billowing, the islands sailed up from their southern feeding grounds in
14835	seemingly endless procession.
14836	Many were !it brilliantly, festooned with colored
14837	lanterns and shifting veils of gossamer light.
14838	'You sure this is the way?" I shouted.
14839	'Yes,' shouted Mike. He did not turn his head. The wind whipped his
14840	long black hair back against my face.
14841	From time to time he would check his compass and make small corrections
14842	to our course. It might have been easier to follow the isles. We
14843	passed one - a large one almost half a kilometer in length - and I
14844	strained to make out details but the isle was dark except for the glow
14845	of its
14846	phosphorescent wake. Dark shapes cut through the milky waves. I tapped
14847	Mike on the shoulder and pointed.
14848	'Dolphins!" he shouted. 'That's what this colony was all about,
14849	remember? A bunch of do-gooders during the Hegira wanted to save all
14850	the mammals in Old Earth's oceans. Didn't succeed."
14851	I would have shouted another question but at that moment the headland
14852	and Firstsite Harbor came into view.
14853	I had thought the stars were bright above Maui-Covenant.
14854	I had thought the migrating islands were memorable in their colorful
14855	display. But the city of First-site, wrapped about with harbor and
14856	hills, was a blazing beacon in the night. Its brilliance reminded me of
14857	a torchship I once had watched while it created its own plasma nova
14858	against the dark limb of a sullen gas giant..
14859	The city was a five-tiered honeycomb of white buildings, all illuminated
14860	by warmly glowing lanterns from within and by countless torches from
14861	without. The white lava-stone of the volcanic island itself seemed to
14862	glow from the city light. Beyond the town were tents, pavilions,
14863	campfires, cooking fires, and great flaming pyres, too large for
14864	function, too large for anything except to serve as a welcome to the
14865	returning isles.
14866	The harbor was filled with boats: bobbing catamarans with cow-bells
14867	clanking from their masts, large-hulled, flat-bottomed house-boats built
14868	for creeping from port to port in the calm equatorial shallows but
14869	proudly ablaze with strings of lights this night, and then the
14870	occasional oceangoing yacht, sleek and functional as a shark.
14871	A lighthouse set out on the pincer's end of the harbor reef threw its
14872	beam far out to sea, illuminated wave and isle alike, and then swept its
14873	light back in to catch the colorful bobbing of ships and men.
14874	Even from two kilometers out we could hear the noise.
14875	Sounds of celebration were clearly audible. Above the shouts and
14876	constant susurration of the surf rose the unmistakable notes of a Bach
14877	flute sonata. I learned later that this welcoming chorus was
14878	transmitted through hydrophones to the Passage Channels where dolphins
14879	leaped and cavorted to the music.
14880	'My God, Mike, how did you know all of this was going on?"
14881	' I asked the main ship computer,' said Mike. The hawking mat banked
14882	right to keep us far out from the ships and lighthouse beam. Then we
14883	curved back in north of Firstsite toward a dark spit o fland. I could
14884	hear the soft booming of waves on the shallows ahead. 'They have this
14885	festival every year,' Mike went on, 'but this is their sesquicentennial.
14886	The party's been going on for three weeks now and is scheduled to
14887	continue another two. There are only about a hundred thousand colonists
14888	on this whole world, Merin, and I bet half of them are here partying."
14889	We slowed, came in carefully, and touched down on a rocky outcropping
14890	not far from the beach. The storm had missed us to the south but
14891	intermittent flashes of lightning and the distant lights of advancing
14892	isles still marked the horizon. Overhead, the stars were not dimmed by
14893	the glow from Firstsite just over the rise from us. The air was warmer
14894	here and I caught the scent of orchards on the breeze. We folded up the
14895	hawking mat and hurried to get into our Harlequin costumes. Mike
14896	slipped his laser pen and jewelry into loose pockets.
14897	'What are those for?" I asked as we secured the backpack and hawking mat
14898	under a large boulder.
14899	'These?" asked Mike as he dangled a Renaissance necklace from his
14900	fingers. 'These are currency in case we have to
14901	negotiate for favors."
14902	'Favors?"
14903	'Favors,' repeated Mike. 'A lady's largesse. Comfort to a weary
14904	spacefarer. Nooky to you, kid."
14905	'Oh,' I said and adjusted my mask and fool's cap. The bells made a soft
14906	sound in the dark.
14907	'Come on,' said Mike. 'We'll miss the party." I nodded and followed
14908	him, bells jangling, as we picked our way over stone and scrub toward
14909	the waiting light.
14910	I sit here in the sunlight and wait. I am not totally certain what I am
14911	waiting for. I can feel a growing warmth on my back as the morning
14912	sunlight is reflected from the white stone of Siri's tomb.
14913	Siri's tomb?
14914	There are no clouds in the sky. I raise my head and squint skyward as
14915	if I might be able to see the L.A. and the newly finished farcaster
14916	array through the glare of atmosphere. I cannot. Part of me knows that
14917	they have not risen yet. Part of me knows to the second the time
14918	remaining before ship and farcaster complete their transit to the
14919	zenith. Part of me does not want to think
14920	about it.
14921	Siri, am I doing the right thing?
14922	There is the sudden sound of pennants stirring on their staffs as the
14923	wind comes up. I sense rather than see the restlessness of the waiting
14924	crowd. For the first time since my planetfall for this, our Seventh
14925	Reunion, I am filled with sorrow. No, not sorrow, not yet, but a
14926	sharp-toothed sadness which soon will open into grief. For years I have
14927	carried on silent conversations with Siri, framing questions to myself
14928	for future discussion with her, and it suddenly strikes me with cold
14929	clarity that we will never again sit together and talk. An emptiness
14930	begins to grow inside me.
14931	· Should I let it happen, Siri?
14932	There is no response except for the growing murmurs of the crowd. In a
14933	few minutes-they will send Donel, my younger and surviving son, or his
14934	daughter Lira and her brother up the hill to urge me on. I toss away
14935	the sprig of willowgrass I've been chewing on. There is a hint of
14936	shadow on the horizon. It could be a cloud. Or it could be the first
14937	of the isles, driven by instinct and the spring northerlies to migrate
14938	back to the great band of the equa torial shallows whence they came. It
14939	does not matter.
14940	Siri, am I doing the right thing?
14941	There is no answer and the time grows shorter.
14942	Sometimes Siri seemed so ignorant it made me sick.
14943	She knew nothing of my life away from her. She would ask questions but
14944	I sometimes wondered if she was interested in the answers. I spent many
14945	hours explaining the beautiful physics behind our spinships but she
14946	never did seem to understand. Once, after I had taken great care to
14947	detail the differences between their ancient seedship and the Los
14948	Angeles, Siri astounded me by asking, 'But why
14949	did it take my ancestors eighty years of shiptime to reach Maul-Covenant
14950	when you can make the trip in a hundred and thirty days?" She had
14951	understood nothing.
14952	Siri's sense of history was, at best, pitiful. She viewed the Hegemony
14953	and the Worldweb the way a child would view the fantasy world of a
14954	pleasant but rather silly myth; there was an indifference there that
14955	almost drove me mad at times.
14956	Siri knew all about the early days of the Hegira - at least insofar as
14957	they pertained to the Maui-Covenant and the colonists - and she
14958	occasionally would come up with delightful bits of archaic trivia or
14959	phraseology, but she knew nothing of post-Hegira realities. Names like
14960	Garden and the Ousters, Renaissance and Lusus meant little to her. I
14961	could mention Salmud Brew or General Horace Glennon-Height and she would
14962	have no associations or reactions at all. None.
14963	The last time I saw Siri she was seventy standard years old. She was
14964	seventy years old and still she had never traveled offworld, used a
14965	fatline, tasted any alcoholic drink except wine, interfaced with an
14966	empathy surgeon, stepped through a farcaster door, smoked a cannahis
14967	stick, received gene tailoring, plugged into a stimsim, received any
14968	formal schooling, taken any RNA medication, heard of Zen Gnostics or the
14969	Shrike Church, or flown any vehicle except an ancient Vikken skimmer
14970	belonging to her family.
14971	Siri had never made love to anyone except me. Or so she said. And so I
14972	believed. ,
14973	It was during our First Reunion, that time on the Archipelago, when Siri
14974	took me to talk with the dolphins.
14975	We had risen to watch the dawn. The highest levels of the tree-house
14976	were a perfect place from which to watch the eastern sky pale and fade
14977	to morning. Ripples of high cirrus turned to rose and then the sea
14978	itself grew molten as the sun floated above the flat horizon.
14979	'Let's go swimming,' said Sift. The rich, horizontal light bathed her
14980	skin and threw her shadow four meters across the boards of the platform.
14981	'I'm too tired,' I said. 'Later." We had lain awake
14982	most of the night talking, making love, talking, and making love again.
14983	In the glare of morning I felt empty and vaguely nauseated. I sensed
14984	the slight movement of the isle under me as a tinge of vertigo, a
14985	drunkard's disconnection from gravity.
14986	'No. Let's go now,' said Siri and grasped my hand to pull me along. I
14987	was irritated but did not argue. Siri was twenty-six, seven years older
14988	than I during that First Reunion, but her impulsive behavior often
14989	reminded me of the teen-aged Siri I had carried away from the Festival
14990	only ten of my months earlier. Her deep, unselfconious laugh was the
14991	same. Her green eyes cut as sharply when she was impatient. The long
14992	mane of auburn hair had not changed. But her body had ripened, filled
14993	out with a promise which had been only hinted at before. Her breasts
14994	were still high and full, almost girlish, bordered above by freckles
14995	that gave way to a whiteness so translucent that a gentle blue tracery
14996	of veins could be seen. But they were different somehow. She was
14997	different.
14998	'Are you going to join me or just sit there staring?" asked Siri. She
14999	had slipped off her caftan as we came out onto the lowest deck. Our
15000	small ship was still tied to the dock. Above us, the island's treesails
15001	were beginning to open to the morning breeze. For the past several days
15002	Siri had insisted on wearing swimstrips when we went into the water. She
15003	wore none now. Her nipples rose in the cool air.
15004	'Won't we be left behind?" I asked, squinting up at the flapping
15005	treesails. On previous days we had waited for the doldrums in the
15006	middle of the day when the isle was still in the water, the sea a glazed
15007	mirror. Now the jibvines were beginning to pull taut as the thick
15008	leaves filled with wind.
15009	'Don't be silly,' said Siri. 'We could always catch a keel-root and
15010	follow it back. That or a feeding tendril. Come on." She tossed an
15011	osmosis mask at me and donned her own. The transparent film made her
15012	face look slick with oil. From the pocket of her discarded caftan she
15013	lifted a thick medallion and set it in place around her neck. The
15014	metal looked dark and ominous against her skin.
15015	'What's that?" I asked.
15016	Siri did not lift the osmosis mask to answer. She set the
15017	comthreads in place against her neck and handed me the earplugs. Her
15018	voice was tinny. 'Translation disk,' she said. 'Thought you knew all
15019	about gadgets, Merin. Last one in's a seaslug." She held the disk in
15020	place between her breasts with one hand and stepped off the isle. I
15021	could see the pale globes of her buttocks as she pirouetted and kicked
15022	for depth. In seconds she was only a white blur deep in the water. I
15023	slipped my own mask on, pressed the comthreads tight, and stepped into
15024	the sea.
15025	The bottom of the isle was a dark stain on a ceiling of crystalline
15026	light. I was wary of the thick feeding tendrils even though Siri had
15027	amply demonstrated that they were interested in devouring nothing larger
15028	than the tiny zooplankton that even now caught the sunlight like dust in
15029	an abandoned ballroom. Keeiroots descended like gnarled stalactites for
15030	hundreds of meters into the purple depths.
15031	The isle was moving. I could see the faint fibrillation of the tendrils
15032	as they trailed along. A wake caught the light ten meters above me. For
15033	a second I was choking, the gel of the mask smothering me as surely as
15034	the surrounding water would, and then I relaxed and the air flowed
15035	freely into my lungs.
15036	'Deeper, Merin,' came Siri's voice. I blinked - a slow-motion blink as
15037	the mask readjusted itself over my eyes- and caught sight of Siri twenty
15038	meters lower, grasping a keelroot and trailing effortlessly above the
15039	colder, deeper currents where the light did not reach. I thought of the
15040	thousands of meters of water under me, of the things which might lurk
15041	there, unknown, unsought out by the human colonists. I thought of the
15042	dark and the depths and my scrotum tightened involuntarily.
15043	'Come on down." Siri's voice was an insect buzz in my ears. I rotated
15044	and kicked. The buoyancy here was not so great as in Old Earth'sseas,
15045	but it still took energy to dive so deep. The mask compensated for
15046	depth and nitrogen but I could feel the pressure against my skin and
15047	ears.
15048	Finally i quit kicking, grabbed a keelroot, and roughly hauled myself
15049	down to Siri's level.
15050	We floated side by side in the dim light. Siri was a
15051	spectral figure here, her long hair swirling in a wine-dark nimbus, the
15052	pale strips of her body glowing in the blue-green light. The surface
15053	seemed impossibly distant. The widening V of the wake and the drift of
15054	the scores of tendrils showed that the isle was moving more quickly now,
15055	moving mindlessly to other feeding grounds, distant waters.
15056	'Where are the..." I began to subvocalize.
15057	'Shhh,' said Siri. She fiddled with the medallion. I could hear them
15058	then: the shrieks and trills and whistles and cat purrs and echoing
15059	cries. The depths were suddenly filled with strange music.
15060	'Jesus,' I said and because Siri had tuned our cornthreads to the
15061	translator, the word was broadcast as a senseless whistle and toot.
15062	'Hello!" she called and the translated greeting echoed from the
15063	transmitter; a high-speed bird's call sliding into the ultrasonic.
15064	'Hello!" she called again.
15065	Minutes passed before the dolphins came to investigate.
15066	They rolled past us, surprisingly large, alarmingly large, their skin
15067	looking slick and muscled in the uncertain light. A large one swam
15068	within a meter of us, turning at the last moment so that the white of
15069	his belly curved past us like a wall. I could see the dark eye rotate
15070	to follow me as he passed. One stroke of his wide fluke kicked up a
15071	turbulence strong enough to convince me of the animal's power.
15072	'Hello,' called Siri but the swift form faded into distant haze and
15073	there was a sudden silence. Siri clicked off the translator. 'Do you
15074	want to talk to them?" she asked.
15075	'Sure." I was dubious. More than three centuries of effort had not
15076	raised much of a dialogue between man and sea mammal. Mike had once
15077	told me that the thought structures of Old Earth's two groups of orphans
15078	were too different, the referents too few. One pre-Hegira expert had
15079	written that speaking to a dolphin or porpoise was about as rewarding as
15080	speaking to a one-year-old human infant. Both sides usually enjoyed the
15081	exchange and there was a simulacrum of conversation, but neither party
15082	would come away the more knowledgeable. Siri switched the translator
15083	disk back on. 'Hello,' I said.
15084	There was a final minute of silence and then our ear-phones were buzzing
15085	while the sea echoed shrill ululations.
15086	distance/noofiuke/heilo-tone?/current pulse/circle me/funny?
15087	'What the hell?" I asked Siri and the translator trilled out my
15088	question. Siri was grinning under her osmosis mask.
15089	I tried again. 'Hello! Greetings from... uh... the surface. How are
15090	you?"
15091	The large male . . . I assumed it to be a male . . .
15092	curved in toward us like a torpedo. He arch-kicked his way through the
15093	water ten times faster than I could have swum even if I had remembered
15094	to don flippers that morning. For a second I thought he was going to
15095	ram us and I raised my knees and clung tightly to the keelroot.
15096	Then he was past us, climbing for air, while Siri and I reeled from his
15097	turbulent wake and the high tones of his shout.
15098	no-fiuke/no-feed/no-swim/no-play/no-fun.
15099	Siri switched off the translator and floated closer. She lightly
15100	grasped my shoulders while I held on to the keel-root with my right
15101	hand. Our legs touched as we drifted through the warm water. A school
15102	of tiny crimson warriorfish flickered above us while the dark shapes of
15103	the dolphins circled farther out.
15104	'Had enough?" she asked. Her hand was flat on my chest.
15105	'One more try,' I said. Siri nodded and twisted the disk to life. The
15106	current pushed us together again. She slid her arm around me.
15107	'Why do you herd the islands?" I asked the bottle-nosed shapes circling
15108	in the dappled light. 'How does it benefit you to stay with the isles?"
15109	sounding now/old songs/deep water/no-Great Voices/no-Shark/old songs/new
15110	songs.
15111	Siri's body lay along the length of me now. Her left arm tightened
15112	around me. 'Great Voices were the whales,' she whispered. Her hair
15113	fanned out in streamers.
15114	Her right hand moved down and seemed surprised at what it found.
15115	'Do you miss the Great Voices?" I asked the shadows.
15116	There was no response. Sift slid her legs around my hips.
15117	The surface was a churning bowl of light forty meters above us.
15118	'What do you miss most of Old Earth's oceans?" I asked.
15119	With my left arm I pulled Sift closer, slid my hand down along the curve
15120	of her back to where her buttocks rose to meet my palm, held her tight.
15121	To the circling dolphins we must have appeared a single-creature. Sift
15122	lifted herself against me and we became a single creature.
15123	The translator disk had twisted around so it trailed over Siri's
15124	shoulder. I reached to shut it off but paused as the answer to my
15125	question buzzed urgently in our ears.
15126	miss Shark/miss Shark/miss Shark/miss Shark/ Shark/Shark/Shark.
15127	I turned off the disk and shook my head. I did not understand.
15128	There was so much I did not understand. I closed my eyes as Siri and I
15129	moved gently to the rhythms of the current and ourselves while the
15130	dolphins swam nearby and the cadenceof their calls took on the sad, slow
15131	trilling of an old lament.
15132	Siri and I came down out of the hills and returned to the Festival just
15133	before sunrise of the second day. For a night and a day we had roamed
15134	the hills, eaten with strangers in pavilions of orange silk, bathed
15135	together in the icy waters of the Shree, and danced to the music which
15136	never ceased going out to the endless file of passing isles. We were
15137	hungry.
15138	I had awakened at sunset to find Siri gone. She returned before the
15139	moon of Maui-Covenant rose. She told me that her parents had gone off
15140	with friends for several days on a slow-moving houseboat. They had left
15141	the family skimmer in Firstsite. Now we worked our way from dance to
15142	dance, bonfire to bonfire, back to the center of the city. We planned
15143	to fly west to her family estate ndlr Fevarone.
15144	It was very late but Firstsite Common still had its share of revelers. I
15145	was very happy. I was nineteen and I was in love and the .93 gravity of
15146	Maui-Covenant seemed much less to me. I could have flown had I wished.
15147	I could have done anything.
15148	We had stopped at a booth and bought fried dough and mugs of black
15149	coffee. Suddenly a thought struck me.
15150	I asked, 'How did you know I was a Shipman?"
15151	'Hush, friend Merin. Eat your poor breakfast. When we get to the
15152	villa, I will fix a true meal to break our fast."
15153	'No, I'm serious,' I said and wiped grease off my chin with the sleeve
15154	of my less than clean Harlequin's costume.
15155	'This morning you said that you knew right away last night that I was
15156	from the ship. Why was that? Was it my accent? My costume? Mike and
15157	I saw other fellows dressed like this."
15158	Siri laughed and brushed back her hair. 'Just be glad it was I who
15159	spied you out, Merin, my love. Had it been my Uncle Gresham or his
15160	friends it would have meant trouble."
15161	'Oh? Why is that?" I picked up one more fried ring and Sift paid for
15162	it. I followed her through the thinning crowd. Despite the motion and
15163	the music all about, I felt weariness beginning to work on me.
15164	'They are Separatists,' said Sift. 'Uncle Gresham recently gave a
15165	speech before the Council urging that we fight rather than agree to be
15166	swallowed into your Hegemony.
15167	He said that we should destroy your farcaster device before it destroys
15168	us."
15169	'Oh?" I said. 'Did he say how he was going to do that?
15170	The last I heard, you folks had no craft to get off-world in."
15171	'Nay, nor for the past fifty years have we,' said Siri.
15172	'But it shows how irrational the Separatists can be."
15173	I nodded. Shipmaster Singh and Councilor Halmyn had briefed us on the
15174	so-called Separatists of Maui-Covenant.
15175	'The usual coalition of colonial jingoists and throwbacks,' Singh had
15176	said. 'Another reason we go slow and develop the world's trade
15177	potential before finishing the fareaster. The Worldweb doesn't need
15178	these yahoos coming in prematurely. And groups like the Separatists are
15179	another reason to keep you crew and construction workers the hell away
15180	from the groundlings."
15181	'Where is your skimmer?" I asked. The Common was emptying quickly. Most
15182	of the bands had packed up their instruments for the night. Gaily
15183	costumed heaps lay
15184	snoring on the grass or cobblestones amid the litter and unlit lanterns.
15185	Only a few enclaves of merriment remained, groups dancing slowly to a
15186	lone guitar or singing drunkenly to themselves. I saw Mike Osho at
15187	once, a patchworked fool, his mask long gone, a girl on either arm. He
15188	was trying to teach the 'Hava Nagilia' to a rapt but inept circle of
15189	admirers. One of the troupe would stumble and they would all fall down.
15190	Mike would flog them to their feet among general laughter and they would
15191	start again, hopping clumsily to his basso profundo chant.
15192	'There it is,' said Siri and pointed to a short line of skimmers parked
15193	behind the Common Hall. I nodded and waved to Mike but he was too busy
15194	hanging on to his two ladies to notice me. Siri and I had crossed the
15195	square and were in the shadows of the old building when the shout went
15196	up.
15197	'Shipmanl Turn around, you Hegemony son of a bitch."
15198	I froze and then wheeled around with fists clenched but no one was near
15199	me. Six young men had descended the steps from the grandstand and were
15200	standing in a semicircle behind Mike. The man in front was tall, slim,
15201	and strikingly handsome. He was twenty-five or twenty-six years old and
15202	his long blond curls spilled down on a crimson silk suit that emphasized
15203	his physique. In his right hand he carried a meter-long sword that
15204	looked to be of tempered steel.
15205	Mike turned slowly. Even from a distance I could see his eyes sobering
15206	as he surveyed the situation. The women at his side and a couple of the
15207	young men in his group tittered as if something humorous had been said.
15208	Mike allowed the inebriated grin to stay on his face. 'You address me,
15209	sir?" he asked.
15210	'I address you, you Hegemony whore's son,' hissed the leader of the
15211	group. His handsome face was twisted into a sneer.
15212	'Bertol,' whispered Siri. 'My cousin. Gresham's younger son." I nodded
15213	and stepped out of the shadows.
15214	Siri caught my arm.
15215	'That is twice you have referred unkindly to my
15216	mother, sir,' slurred Mike. 'Have she or I offended you in some way? If
15217	so, a thousand pardons." Mike bowed so deeply that the bells on his cap
15218	almost brushed the ground. Members of his group applauded.
15219	'Your presence offends me, you Hegemony bastard.
15220	You stink up our air with your fat carcass."
15221	Mike's eyebrows rose comically. A young man near him in a fish costume
15222	waved his hand. 'Oh, come on, Bertol. He's just..."
15223	'Shut up, Ferick. It is this fat shithead I am speaking to."
15224	'Shithead?" repeated Mike, eyebrows still raised. 'I've traveled two
15225	hundred light-years to be called a fat shit-head?
15226	It hardly seems worth it." He pivoted gracefully, untangling himself
15227	from the women as he did so. I would have joined Mike then but Siri
15228	clung tightly to my arm, whispering unheard entrearies. When I was free
15229	I saw that Mike was still smiling, still playing the fool. But his left
15230	hand was in his baggy shirt pocket.
15231	'Give him your blade, Creg,' snapped Bertol. One of the younger men
15232	tossed a sword hilt-first to Mike. Mike watched it arc by and clang
15233	loudly on the cobblestones.
15234	'You can't be serious,' said Mike in a soft voice that was suddenly
15235	quite sober. 'You cretinous cow turd. Do you really think I'm going to
15236	play duel with you just because you get a hard-on acting the hero for
15237	these yokels?"
15238	'Pick up the sword,' screamed Bertol, 'or, by God, I'll carve you where
15239	you stand." He took a quick step forward.
15240	The youth's face contorted with fury as he advanced.
15241	'Fuck off,' said Mike. In his left hand was the laser pen.
15242	'No!" I yelled and ran into the light. That pen was used by
15243	construction workers to scrawl marks on girders of whiskered alloy.
15244	Things happened very quickly then. Bertoi took another step and Mike
15245	flicked the green beam across him almost casually. The colonist let out
15246	a cry and leaped back; a smoking line of black was slashed diagonally
15247	across his silk shirtfront. I hesitated. Mike had the
15248	setting as low as it could go. Two of Bertol's friends started forward
15249	and Mike swung the light across their shins. One dropped to his knees
15250	cursing and the other hopped away holding his leg and hooting.
15251	A crowd had gathered. They laughed as Mike swept off his fooi's cap in
15252	another bow. 'I thank you,' said Mike. 'My mother thanks you."
15253	Siri's cousin strained against his rage. Froths of spittle spilled on
15254	his lips and chin. I pushed through the crowd and stepped between Mike
15255	and the tail colonist.
15256	'Hey, it's all right,' I said. 'We're leaving. We're going now.".
15257	'Goddamn it, Merin, get out of the way,' said Mike.
15258	'It's all right,' I said as I turned to him. 'l'm with a girl named
15259	Siri who has a..." Bertol stepped forward and lunged past me with his
15260	blade. I wrapped my left arm around his shoulder and flung him back. He
15261	tumbled heavily onto the grass.
15262	'Oh, shit,' said Mike as he backed up several paces. He looked tired
15263	and a little disgusted as he sat down on a stone step. 'Aw, damn,' he
15264	said softly. There was a short line of crimson in one of the black
15265	patches on the left side of his Harlequin costume. As I watched, the
15266	narrow slit spilled over and blood ran down across Mike Osho's broad
15267	belly.
15268	'Oh, Jesus, Mike." I tore a strip of fabric from my shirt and tried to
15269	staunch the flow. I could remember none of the first aid we'd been
15270	taught as mid-Shipmen. I pawed at my wrist but my cornlog was not
15271	there. We had left them on the Los Angeles.
15272	'It's not so bad, Mike,' I gasped. 'It's. just a little cut." The
15273	blood flowed down over my hand and wrist.
15274	'It will serve,' said Mike. His voice was held taut by a cord of pain.
15275	'Damn. A fucking sword. Do you believe it, Merin? Cut down in the
15276	prime of my prime by a piece of fucking cutlery out of a fucking
15277	one-penny opera. Oh, damn, that smarts."
15278	'Three-penny opera,' I said and changed hands. The rag was soaked.
15279	'You know what your fucking problem is, Merin?
15280	You're always sticking your fucking two cents in.
15281	Awwwww." Mike's face went white and then gray. He lowered his chin to
15282	his chest and breathed deeply. 'To hell with this, kid. Let's go home,
15283	huh?"
15284	I looked over my shoulder. Bertol was slowly moving away with his
15285	friends. The rest of the crowd milled around in shock. 'Call a
15286	doctor!" I screamed. 'Get some medics up here!" Two men ran down the
15287	street. There was no sign of Siri.
15288	'Wait a minute! Wait a minute!" said Mike in a stronger voice as if he
15289	had forgotten something important.
15290	'Just a minute,' he said and died.
15291	Died. A real death. Brain death. His mouth opened obscenely, his eyes
15292	rolled back so only the whites showed, and a minute later the blood
15293	ceased pumping from the wound.
15294	For a few mad seconds I cursed the sky. I could see the L.A. moving
15295	across the fading starfield and I knew that I could bring Mike back if I
15296	could get him there in a few minutes. The crowd backed away as I
15297	screamed and ranted at the stars.
15298	Eventually I turned to Bertol. 'You,' I said.
15299	The young man had stopped at the far end of the Common. His face was
15300	ashen. He stared wordlessly.
15301	'You,' I said again. I picked up the laser pen from where it had
15302	rolled, clicked the power to maximum, and walked to where Bertol and his
15303	friends stood waiting.
15304	Later, through the haze of screams and scorched flesh, I was dimly aware
15305	of Siri's skimmer setting down in the crowded square, of dust flying up
15306	all around, and of her voice commanding me to join her. We lifted away
15307	from the light and madness. The cool wind blew my sweat-soaked hair
15308	away from my neck.
15309	'We will go to Fevarone,' said Siri. 'Bertol was drunk.
15310	The Separatists are a small, violent group. There will be no reprisals.
15311	You will stay with me until the Council holds the inquest."
15312	'No,' I said. 'There. Land there." I pointed to a spit of land not far
15313	from the city.
15314	Siri landed despite her protests. I glanced at the boulder to make sure
15315	the backpack was still there and then climbed out of the skimmer. Siri
15316	slid across the seat and
15317	pulled my head down to hers. 'Merin, my love." Her lips were warm and
15318	open but I felt nothing. My body felt anesthetized. I stepped back and
15319	waved her away. She brushed her hair back and stared at me from green
15320	eyes filled with tears. Then the skimmer lifted, turned, and sped to
15321	the south in the early morning light.
15322	Just a minute, I felt like calling. I sat on a rock and gripped my
15323	knees as several ragged sobs were torn up out of me. Then I stood and
15324	threw the laser pen into the surf below. I tugged out the backpack and
15325	dumped the contents on the ground.
15326	The hawking mat was gone.
15327	I sat back down, too drained to laugh or cry or walk away. The sun rose
15328	as I sat there. I was still sitting there three hours later when the
15329	large black skimmer from ShipSecurity set down silently beside me.
15330	'Father? Father, it is getting late."
15331	I turn to see my son Donel standing behind me. He is wearing the blue
15332	and gold robe of the Hegemony Council.
15333	His bald scalp is flushed and beaded with sweat.
15334	Donel is only forty-three but he seems much older to me.
15335	'Please, Father,' he says. I nod and rise, brushing off the grass and
15336	dirt. We walk together to the front of the tomb. The crowd has pressed
15337	closer now. Gravel crunches under their feet as they shift restlessly.
15338	'Shall I enter with you, Father?" Donel asks.
15339	I pause to look at this aging stranger who is my child.
15340	There is little of Siri or me reflected in him. His face is friendly,
15341	florid, and tense with the excitement of the day.
15342	I can sense in him the open honesty which often takes the place of
15343	intelligence in some people. I cannot help but compare this balding
15344	puppy of a man to A!bn - A!bn of the dark curls and silences and
15345	sardonic smile. But Albn is thirty-three years dead, cut down in a
15346	stupid battle which had nothing to do with him.
15347	'No,' ! say. 'I'll go in by myself. Thank you, Donel." He nods and
15348	steps back. The pennants snap above the heads of the straining crowd. I
15349	turn my attention to the tomb.
15350	The entrance is sealed with a palmlock. I have only to touch it.
15351	During the past few minutes I have developed a fantasy which will save
15352	me from both the growing sadness within and the external series o f
15353	events which I have initiated. Siri is not dead. In the last stages of
15354	her illness she had called together the doctors and the few technicians
15355	left in the colony and they rebuilt for her one of the ancient
15356	hibernation chambers used in their seedship two centuries earlier.
15357	Siri is only sleeping. What is more, the year-long sleep has somehow
15358	restored her youth. When I wake her she will be the Siri I remember
15359	from our early days. We will walk out into the sunlight together and
15360	when the farcaster doors
15361	open we shall be the first through.
15362	'Father?"
15363	'Yes." I step forward and set my hand to the door of the crypt. There
15364	is a whisper of electric motors and the white slab of stone slides back.
15365	I bow my head and enter Siri's tomb.
15366	'Damn it, Merin, secure that line before it knocks you overboard.
15367	Hurry!" I hurried. The wet rope was hard to coil, harder to tie off.
15368	Siri shook her head in disgust and leaned over to tie a bowline knot
15369	with one hand.
15370	It was our Sixth Reunion. I had been three months too late for her
15371	birthday but more than five thousand other people had made it to the
15372	celebration. The CEO of the All Thing had wished her well in a
15373	forty-minute speech. A poet read his most recent verses to the Love
15374	Cycle sonnets.
15375	The Hegemony Ambassador had presented her with a scroll and a new ship,
15376	a small submersible powered by the first fusion cells to be allowed on
15377	Maul-Covenant.
15378	Siri had eighteen other ships. Twelve belonged to her fleet of swift
15379	catamarans that plied their trade between the wandering Archipelago and
15380	the home islands. Two were b.autiful racing yachts that were used only
15381	twice a year to wm the Founder's Regatta and the Covenant Criterium.
15382	The other four craft were ancient fishing boats, homely and awkward,
15383	well maintained but little more than scows.
15384	Siri had nineteen ships but we were on a fishing boat - the Ginnie Paul.
15385	For the past eight days we had
15386	fished the shelf of the Equatorial Shallows; a crew of two, casting and
15387	pulling nets, wading knee-deep through stinking fish and crunching
15388	trilobites, wallowing over every wave, casting and pulling nets, keeping
15389	watch, and sleeping like exhausted children during our brief rest
15390	periods. I was not quite twenty-three. I thought I was used to heavy
15391	labor aboard the L.,4. and it was my custom to put in an hour of
15392	exercise in the I.3-g pod every second shift, but now my arms and back
15393	ached from the strain and my hands were blistered between the calluses.
15394	Siri had just turned seventy.
15395	'Merin, go forward and reef the foresail. Do the same for the jib and
15396	then go below to see to the sandwiches.
15397	Plenty of mustard."
15398	I nodded and went forward. For a day and a half we had been playing
15399	hide-and-seek with a storm: sailing before it when we could, turning
15400	about and accepting its punishment when we had to. At first it had been
15401	exciting, a welcome respite from the endless casting and pulling and
15402	mending. But after the first few hours the adrenaline rush faded to be
15403	replaced by constant nausea, fatigue, and a terrible tiredness. The
15404	seas did not relent. The waves grew to six meters and higher. The
15405	Ginnie Paul wallowed like the broad-beamed matron she was. Everything
15406	was wet. My skin was soaked under three layers of rain gear. For Siri
15407	it was a long-awaited vacation.
15408	'This is nothing,' she had said during the darkest hour of the night as
15409	waves washed over the deck and smashed against the scarred plastic of
15410	the cockpit. 'You should see it during simoon season."
15411	The clouds still hung low and blended into gray waves in the distance
15412	but the sea was down to a gentle five-foot chop. I spread mustard
15413	across the roast beef sandwiches and poured steaming coffee into thick
15414	white mugs. It would have been easier to transport the coffee in zero-g
15415	without spilling it than to get up the pitching shaft of the
15416	companionway. Siri accepted her depleted cup without commenting. We
15417	sat in silence for a bit, appreciating the food and the tongue-scalding
15418	warmth. I took the wheel when Siri went below to refill our mugs. The
15419	gray day was dimming almost imperceptibly into night.
15420	'Merin,' she said after handing me my mug and taking a seat on the long
15421	cushioned bench which encircled the cockpit, 'what will happen after
15422	they open the farcaster?"
15423	l was surprised by the question. We had almost never talked about the
15424	time when Maul-Covenant would join the Hegemony. I glanced over at Siri
15425	and was struck by how ancient she suddenly seemed. Her face was a
15426	mosaic of seams and shadows. Her beautiful green eyes had sunken into
15427	wells of darkness and her cheekbones were knife edges against brittle
15428	parchment. She kept her gray hair cut short now and it stuck out in
15429	damp spikes. Her neck and wrists were tendoned cords emerging from a
15430	shapeless sweater.
15431	'What do you mean?" I asked.
15432	'What will happen after they open the farcaster?" 'You know what the
15433	Council says, Siri." I spoke loudly because she was hard of hearing in
15434	one ear. 'It will open a new era of trade and technology for
15435	Maul-Covenant.
15436	And you won't be restricted to one little world any longer. When you
15437	become citizens, everyone will be entitled to use the farcaster doors."
15438	'Yes,' said Siri. Her voice was weary. 'I have heard all of that,
15439	Merin. But what will happen? Who will be the first through to us?"
15440	I shrugged. 'More diplomats, I suppose. Cultural contact specialists.
15441	Anthropologists. Ethnologists. Marine biologists."
15442	'And then?"
15443	I paused. It was dark out. The sea was almost gentle.
15444	Our running lights glowed red and green against the night. I felt the
15445	same anxiety I had known two days earlier when the wall of storm
15446	appeared on the horizon.
15447	I said, 'And then will come the missionaries.
15448	The petroleum geologists. The sea farmers. The developers. '
15449	Siri sipped at her coffee. 'I would have thought your Hegemony was far
15450	beyond a petroleum economy."
15451	I laughed and locked the wheel in. 'Nobody gets beyond a petroleum
15452	economy. Not while there's petroleum there. We don't burn it, if
15453	that's what you mean.
15454	But it's still essential for the production of plastics, synthetics,
15455	food base, and keroids. Two hundred billion people use a lot of
15456	plastic."
15457	'And Mani-Covenant has oil?"
15458	'Oh, yes,' I said. There was no more laughter in me.
15459	'There are billions of barrels reservoired under the Equatorial Shallows
15460	alone."
15461	'How will they get it, Merin? Platforms?"
15462	'Yeah. Platforms. Submersibles. Sub-sea colonies with tailored
15463	workers brought in from Mare Infinitus."
15464	'And the motile isles?" asked Siri. 'They must return each year to the
15465	shallows to feed on the bluekelp there and to reproduce. What will
15466	become of the isles?"
15467	I shrugged again. I had drunk too much coffee and it had left a bitter
15468	taste in my mouth. 'I don't know,' I said.
15469	'They haven't told the crew much. But back on our first trip out, Mike
15470	heard that they planned to develop as many of the isles as they can so
15471	some will be protected."
15472	'Develop?" Siri's voice showed surprise for the first time. 'How can
15473	they develop the isles? Even the First Families must ask permission of
15474	the Sea Folk to build our treehouse retreats there."
15475	I smiled at Siri's use of the local term for the dolphins.
15476	The Maul-Covenant colonists were such children when it came to their
15477	damned dolphins. 'The plans are all set,' I said. 'There are I28,573
15478	motile isles big enough to build a dwelling on. Leases to those have
15479	long since been sold.
15480	The smaller isles will be broken up, I suppose. The home islands will
15481	be developed for recreation purposes."
15482	'Recreation purposes,' echoed Siri. 'How many-peo-ple from the Hegemony
15483	will use the farcaster to come here... for recreation purposes?"
15484	'At first, you mean?" I asked. 'Just a few thousand the first year. As
15485	long as the only door is on Island 24I...
15486	the Trade Center . . . it will be limited. Perhaps 'fifty thousand
15487	the second year when Firstsite gets its door.
15488	It'll be quite the luxury tour. Always is after a seed
15489	colony is first opened to the Web."
15490	'And later?"
15491	'After the five-year probation? There will be thousands of doors, of
15492	course. I would imagine that there will
15493	be twenty or thirty million new residents coming through during the
15494	first year of full citizenship."
15495	'Twenty or thirty million,' said Siri. The light from the compass stand
15496	illuminated her lined face from below.
15497	There was still a beauty there. But there was no anger or shock. I had
15498	expected both.
15499	'But you'll be citizens then yourself,' I said. 'Free to step anywhere
15500	in the Worldweb. There will be sixteen new worlds to choose from.
15501	Probably more by then."
15502	'Yes,' said Siri and set aside her empty mug. A fine rain streaked the
15503	glass around us. The crude radar screen set in its hand-carved frame
15504	showed the seas empty, the storm past. 'Is it true, Merin, that people
15505	in the Hegemony have their homes on a dozen worlds? One house, I mean,
15506	with windows facing out on a dozen skies?"
15507	'Sure,' I said. 'But not many people. Only the rich can afford
15508	multiworld residences like that."
15509	Siri smiled and set her hand on my knee. The back of her hand was
15510	mottled and blue-veined. 'But you are very rich, are you not, Shipman?"
15511	I looked away. 'Not yet I'm not."
15512	'Ah, but soon, Merin, soon. How long for you, my love? Less than two
15513	weeks here and then the voyage back to your Hegemony. Five months more
15514	of your time to bring the last components back, a few weeks to finish,
15515	and then you step home a rich man. Step two hundred empty light-years
15516	home. What a strange thought... but where was I? That is how long?
15517	Less than a standard year."
15518	'Ten months,' I said. 'Three hundred and six standard days. Three
15519	hundred fourteen of yours. Nine hundred eighteen shifts."
15520	'And then your exile will be over."
15521	'Yes."
15522	'And you wili be twenty-four years old and very rich." 'Yes."
15523	'I'm tired, Merin. I want to sleep now."
15524	We programmed the tiller, set the collision alarm, and went below. The
15525	wind had risen some and the old vessel
15526	wallowed from wave crest to trough with every swell. We undressed in
15527	the dim light of the swinging lamp. I was first in the bunk and under
15528	the covers. It was the first time Siri and I had shared a sleep period.
15529	Remembering our last Reunion and her shyness at the villa, I expected
15530	her to douse the light. Instead she stood a minute, nude in the chill
15531	air, thin arms calmly at her sides.
15532	Time had claimed Siri but had not ravaged her. Gravity had done its
15533	inevitable work on her breasts and buttocks and she was much thinner. I
15534	stared at the gaunt outlines of ribs and breastbone and remembered the
15535	sixteen-year=old girl with baby fat and skin like warm velvet. In the
15536	cold light of the swinging lamp I stared at Siri's sagging flesh and
15537	remembered moonlight on budding breasts. Yet somehow, strangely,
15538	inexplicably, it was the same Siri who stood before me now.
15539	'Move over, Merin." She slipped into the bunk beside me. The sheets
15540	were cool against our skin, the rough blanket welcome. I turned off the
15541	light. The little ship swayed to the regular rhythm of the sea's
15542	breathing. I could hear the sympathetic creak of masts and rigging.
15543	In the morning we could be casting and pulling and mending but now there
15544	was time to sleep. I began to doze
15545	to the sound of waves against wood.
15546	'Merin?" 'Yes."
15547	'What would happen if the Separatists attacked the Hegemony tourists or
15548	the new residents?"
15549	'I thought the Separatists had all been carted off to he isles."
15550	'They have been. But what if they resisted?"
15551	'Tbe Hegemony would send in FORCE troops who could kick the shit out of
15552	the Separatists."
15553	'What if the farcaster itself were attacked ...
15554	destroyed before it was operational?"
15555	'Impossible."
15556	'Yes, I know, but what if it were?"
15557	'Then the LosAngeles would return nine months later with Hegemony troops
15558	who would proceed to kick the shit out of the Separatists... and anyone
15559	else on Maui-Covenant who got in their way."
15560	'Nine months' shiptime,' said Siri. 'Eleven years of our time."
15561	'But inevitable either way,' I said. 'Let's talk about something else."
15562	'All right,' said Siri but we did not speak. I listened to the crack
15563	and sigh of the ship. Siri had nestled in the hollow of my arm. Her
15564	head was on my shoulder and her breathing was so deep and regular that I
15565	thought her to be asleep. I was almost asleep myself when her warm hand
15566	slid up my leg and lightly cupped me. I was startled even as I began to
15567	stir and stiffen. Siri whispered an answer to my unasked question. 'No,
15568	Merin, one is never really too old.
15569	At least not too old to want the warmth and closeness.
15570	You decide, my love. I will be content either way."
15571	I decided. Toward the dawn we slept.
15572	The tomb is empty.
15573	'Donel, come in here!'
15574	He bustles in, robes rustling in the hollow emptiness.
15575	The tomb/s empty. There is no hibernation chamber - I did not truly
15576	expect there to be one - but neither is there sarcophagus or coffin. A
15577	bright bulb illuminates the white interior. 'What the hell is this,
15578	Donel? I thought this was Siri's tomb."
15579	'It is, Father."
15580	'Where is she interred? Under the floor for Chrissake?" Donel mops at
15581	his brow. I remember that it is his mother I am speaking of. I also
15582	remember that he has had almost
15583	two years to accustom himself to the idea of her death.
15584	'No one told you?" he asks.
15585	'Told me what?" The anger and confusion are already ebbing. 'I was
15586	rushed here from the dropship station and told that I was to visit
15587	Siri's tomb before the farcaster opening. What?"
15588	'Mother was cremated as per her instructions. Her ashes were spread on
15589	the Great South Sea from the highest platform of the family isle."
15590	'Then why this... crypt?" I watch what I say. Donel is sensitive.
15591	He mops his brow again and glances to the door. We are shielded from
15592	the view of the crowd but we are far behind
15593	schedule. Already the other members of the Council have had to hurry
15594	down the hill to join the dignitaries on the bandstand. My slow grief
15595	this day has been worse than bad timing - it has turned into bad
15596	theater.
15597	'Mother left instructions. They were carried out." He touches a panel
15598	on the inner wall and it slides up to reveal
15599	a small niche containing a metal box. My name is on it.
15600	'What is that?"
15601	Donel shakes his head. 'Personal items Mother left for you. Only
15602	Magritte knew the details and she died last winter without telling
15603	anyone."
15604	'All right,' I say. 'Thank you. I'll be out in a moment." Donel
15605	glances at his chronometer. 'The ceremony begins in eight minutes. They
15606	will activate the farcaster in twenty minutes."
15607	'I know,' I say. I do know. Part of me knows precisely how much time
15608	is left. 'VII be out in a moment."
15609	Donel hesitates and then departs. I close the door behind him with a
15610	touch of my palm. The metal box is surprisingly heavy. I set it on the
15611	stone floor and crouch beside it. A smaller palmlock gives me access.
15612	The lid clicks open and I peer into the container.
15613	'Well I'll be damned,' I say softly. I do not know what I expected-
15614	artifacts perhaps, nostalgic mementos of our hundred and three days
15615	together - perhaps a pressed flower from some forgotten offering or the
15616	frenchhorn conch we dove for off Fevarone. But there are no mementos -
15617	not as such.
15618	The box holds a small Steiner-Ginn handlaser, one of the most powerful
15619	projection weapons ever made. The accumulator is attached by a power
15620	lead to a small fusion cell that Siri must have cannibalized from her
15621	new submersible. Also attached to the fusion cell is an ancient
15622	cornlog, an antique with a solid state interior and a liquid crystal
15623	diskey. The charge indicator glows green.
15624	There are two other objects in the box. One is the translator medallion
15625	we had used so long ago. The final object makes me literally gape in
15626	surprise.
15627	'Why, you little bitch,' I say. Things fall into place. I cannot stop
15628	a smile. 'You dear, conniving, little bitch."
15629	There, rolled carefully, power lead correctly attached,
15630	lies the hawking mat Mike Osho bought in Carvnel Marketplace for thirty
15631	marks. I leave the hawking mat there, disconnect the comlog, and lift
15632	it out. I sit crosslegged on the cold stone and thumb the diskey. The
15633	light in the crypt fades out and suddenly Siri is there before me.
15634	They did not throw me off the ship when Mike died.
15635	They could have but they did not. They did not leave me to the mercy of
15636	provincial justice on Maui-Covenant.
15637	They could have but they chose not to. For two days I was held in
15638	Security and questioned, once by Shipmaster Singh himself. Then they
15639	let me return to duty. For the four months of the long leap back I
15640	tortured myself with the memory of Mike's murder. I knew that in my
15641	clumsy way I had helped to murder him. I put in my shifts, dreamed my
15642	sweaty nightmares, and wondered if they would dismiss me when we reached
15643	the Web. They could have told me but they chose not to.
15644	They did not dismiss me. I was to have my normal leave in the Web but
15645	could take no off-Ship R and R while in the Maui-Covenant system. In
15646	addition, there was a written reprimand and temporary reduction in rank.
15647	That was what Mike's life had been worth- a reprimand and reduction in
15648	rank.
15649	I took my three-week. leave with the rest of the crew but, unlike the
15650	others, I did not plan to return. I farcast to Esperance and made the
15651	classic Shipman's mistake of trying to visit family. Two days in the
15652	crowded residential bulb was enough and I stepped to Lusus and took my
15653	pleasure in three days of whoring on the Rue des Chats.
15654	When my mood turned darker I 'cast to Fuji and lost most of my ready
15655	marks betting on the bloody samurai fights there.
15656	Finally I found myself farcasting to Homesystem Station and taking the
15657	two-day pilgrim shuttle down to Hellas Basin. I had never been to
15658	Homesystem or Mars before and I never plan to return, but the ten days I
15659	spent there, alone and wandering the dusty, haunted corridors of the
15660	Monastery, served to send me back to the ship.
15661	Back to Siri.
15662	Occasionally I would leave the red-stoned maze of the
15663	megalith and, clad only in skinsuit and mask, stand on one of the
15664	uncounted thousands of stone balconies and stare skyward at the pale
15665	gray star which had once been Old Earth. Sometimes then I thought of
15666	the brave and stupid idealists heading out into the great dark in their
15667	slow and leaking ships, carrying embryos and ideologies with equal faith
15668	and care. But most times I did not try to think. Most times I simply
15669	stood in the purple night and let Siri come to me. There in the
15670	Master's Rock, where perfect satori had eluded so many much worthier
15671	pilgrims, I achieved it through the memory of a not quite
15672	sixteen-year-old womanchild's body lying next to mine while moonlight
15673	spilled from a Thomas Hawk's wings.
15674	When the Los Angeles spun back up to a quantum state, I went with her.
15675	Four months later I was content to pull my shift with the construction
15676	crew, plug into my usual stims, and sleep my R and R away. Then Singh
15677	came to me. 'You're going down,' he said. I did not understand. 'In
15678	the past eleven years the groundlings have turned your screw-up with
15679	Osho into a goddamned legend,' said Singh. 'There's an entire cultural
15680	mythos built around your little roll in the hay with that colonial
15681	girl."
15682	'Siri,' I said.
15683	'Get your gear,' said Singh. 'You'll spend your three weeks groundside.
15684	The Ambassador's experts say you'll do the Hegemony'more good down there
15685	than up here.
15686	We'll see."
15687	The world was waiting. Crowds were cheering. Siri was waving. We left
15688	the harbor in a yellow catamaran and sailed south-southeast, bound for
15689	the Archipelago and her family isle.
15690	'Hello, Merin." Siri floats in the darkness of her tomb.
15691	The holo is not perfect; a haziness mars the edges. But it is Siri -
15692	Siri as I last saw, gray hair shorn rather than cut, head high, face
15693	sharpened with shadows. 'Hello, Merin, my love."
15694	'Hello, Siri,' I say. The tomb door is closed.
15695	'I am sorry I cannot share our Seventh Reunion, Merin. I looked forward
15696	to it." Siri pauses and looks
15697	down at her hands. The image flickers slightly as dust motes float
15698	through her form. 'I had carefully planned what to say here,' she goes
15699	on. 'How to say it. Arguments to be pied. Instructions to be given.
15700	But I know how useless that would have been. Either I have said it
15701	already and you have heard or there is nothing left to say and silence
15702	would best suit the moment."
15703	Siri's voice had grown even more beautiful with age.
15704	There is a fullness and calmness there which can come only from knowing
15705	pain. Siri moves her hands and they disappear beyond the border of the
15706	projection. 'Merin, my love, how strange our days apart and together
15707	have been. How beautifully absurd the myth that bound us.
15708	My days were but heartbeats to you. I hated you for that.
15709	You were the mirror that would not lie. If you could have seen your
15710	face at the beginning of each Reunion! The least you could have done
15711	was to hide your shock...
15712	that, at least, you could have done for me.
15713	'But through your clumsy naivet there has always been... what?...
15714	something, Merin. There is something there that belies the callowhess
15715	and thoughtless egotism which you wear so well. A caring, perhaps. A
15716	respect for caring, if nothing else.
15717	'Merin, this diary has hundreds of entries... thousands, I fear... I
15718	have kept it since I was thirteen. By the time you see this, they will
15719	all have been erased except the ones which follow. Adieu, my love.
15720	Adieu."
15721	I shut off the comlog and sit in silence for a minute. The crowd sounds
15722	are barely audible through the thick walls of the tomb. I take a breath
15723	and thumb the diskey.
15724	Siri appears. She is in her late forties. I know immediately the day
15725	and place she recorded this image. I remember the cloak she wears, the
15726	eelstone pendant at her neck, and the strand of hair which has escaped
15727	her barrette and even now falls across her cheek. I remember everything
15728	about that day. It was the last day of our Third Reunion and we were
15729	with friends on the heights above South Tern. Donel was ten and we were
15730	trying to convince him to slide on the snowfield with us. He was
15731	crying. Siri turned away from us even before the skimmer settled.
15732	When Magritte stepped out we knew from Siri's face that something had
15733	happened.
15734	The same face stares at me now. She brushes absently at the unruly
15735	strand of hair. Her eyes are red but her voice is controlled. 'Merin,
15736	they killed our son today.
15737	Albn was twenty-one and they killed him. You were so confused today,
15738	Merin. "How could such a mistake have happened?" you kept repeating.
15739	You did not really know our son but I could see the loss in your face
15740	when we heard. Merin, it was not an accident. If nothing else
15741	survives, no other record, if you never understand why I allowed a
15742	sentimental myth to rule my life, let this be known - it was not an
15743	accident that killed Albn. He was with the Separatists when the Council
15744	police arrived.
15745	Even then he could have escaped. We had prepared an alibi together. The
15746	police would have believed his story.
15747	He chose to stay.
15748	'Today, Merin, you were impressed with what I said to the crowd... the
15749	mob... at the embassy. Know this, Shipman - when I said, "Now is not
15750	the time to show your anger and your hatred," that is precisely what I
15751	meant. No more, no less. Today is not the time. But the day will
15752	come. It will surely come. The Covenant was not taken lightly in those
15753	final days, Merin. It is not taken lightly now. Those who have
15754	forgotten will be surprised when the day comes but it will surely come."
15755	The image fades to another and in the split second of overlap the face
15756	of a twenty-six-year-old Siri appears superimposed on the older woman's
15757	features. 'Merin, I am pregnant. I'm so glad. You've been gone five
15758	weeks now and I miss. you. Ten years you'll be gone. More than that.
15759	Merin, why didn't you think to invite me to go with you? I could not
15760	have gone but I would have loved it if you had just invited me. But I'm
15761	pregnant, Merin. The doctors say that it will be a boy. I will tell
15762	him about you, my love. Perhaps someday you and he will sail in the
15763	Archipelago and listen to the songs of the Sea Folk as you and I have
15764	done these past few weeks. Perhaps you'll understand them by then.
15765	Merin, I miss' you. Please hurry back."
15766	The holographic image shimmers and shifts. The sixteen-year-old girl is
15767	red-faced. Her long hair cascades over bare shoulders and a white
15768	nightgown. She speaks in a rush, racing tears. 'Shipman Merin Aspic,
15769	I'm sorry about your friend - I really am - but you left without even
15770	saying goodbye. I had such plans about how you would help us... how
15771	you and I... you didn't even say goodbye. I don't care what happens to
15772	you. I hope you go back to your stinking, crowded Hegemony hives and
15773	rot for all I care. In fact, Merin Aspic, I wouldn't want to see you
15774	again even if they paid me. Goodbye."
15775	She turns her back before the projection fades. It is dark in the tomb
15776	now but the audio continues for a second. There is a soft chuckle and
15777	Siri's voice - I cannot tell the age - comes one last time. 'Adieu,
15778	Merin.
15779	Adieu."
15780	'Adieu,' I say and thumb the diskey off.
15781	The crowd parts as I emerge blinking from the tomb. My poor timing has
15782	ruined the drama of the event and now the smile on my face incites angry
15783	whispers. Loudspeakers carry the rhetoric of the official ceremony even
15784	to our hilltop. '... beginning a new era of cooperation,' echoes the
15785	rich voice of the Ambassador.
15786	I set the box on the grass and remove the hawking mat.
15787	The crowd presses forward to see as I unroll the carpet.
15788	The tapestry is faded but the flight threads gleam like new copper. I
15789	sit in the center of the mat and slide the heavy box on behind me.
15790	'... and more will follow until space and time will cease to be
15791	obstacles."
15792	The crowd moves back as I tap the flight design and the hawking mat
15793	rises four meters into the air. Now I can see beyond the roof of the
15794	tomb. The islands are returning to form the Equatorial Archipelago. I
15795	can see them, hundreds of them, borne up out of the hungry south by
15796	gentle winds.
15797	'So it is with great' pleasure that I close this circuit and welcome
15798	you, the colony of Maui-Covenant, into the community of the Hegemony of
15799	Man."
15800	The thin thread of the ceremonial comm-laser pulses
15801	to the zenith. There is a spattering of applause and the band begins
15802	playing. I squint skyward just in time to see a new star being born.
15803	Part of me knew to the microsecond what has just occurred.
15804	For a few microseconds the farcaster had been functional.
15805	For a few microseconds time and space had ceased to be obstacles. Then
15806	the massive tidal pull of the artificial singularity triggered the
15807	thermite charge I had placed on the outer containment sphere. That tiny
15808	explosion had not been visible but a second later the expanding
15809	Schwarzschild radius is eating its shell, swallowing thirty-six thousand
15810	tons of fragile dodecahedron, and growing quickly to gobble several
15811	thousand kilometers of space around it. And that is visible -
15812	magnificently visible - as a miniature nova flares whitely in the clear
15813	blue sky.
15814	The band stops playing. People scream and run for cover. There is no
15815	reason to. There is a burst of X rays tunneling out as the farcaster
15816	continues to collapse into itself, but not enough to cause harm through
15817	Maui-Covenant's generous atmosphere. A second streak of plasma becomes
15818	visible as the Los Angeles puts more distance between itself and the
15819	rapidly decaying little black hole. The winds rise and the seas are
15820	choppier.
15821	There will be strange tides tonight.
15822	I want to say something profound but I can think of nothing. Besides,
15823	the crowd is in no mood to listen. I tell myself that I can hear some
15824	cheers mixed in with the screams and shouts.
15825	I tap at the flight designs and the hawking mat speeds out over the
15826	cliff and above the harbor. A Thomas Hawk lazing on midday thermals
15827	flaps in panic at my approach.
15828	'Let them come!" I shout at the fleeing hawk. 'Let them come! I'll be
15829	thirty-five and not alone and let them come if they dare!" I drop my
15830	fist and laugh. The wind is blowing my hair and cooling the sweat on my
15831	chest and arms.
15832	Cooler now, I take a sighting and set my course for the most distant of
15833	the isles. I look forward to meeting the others. Even more, I look
15834	forward to talking to the Sea
15835	Folk and telling them that it is time for the Shark to come at last to
15836	the seas of Maui-Covenant.
15837	Later, when the battles are won and the world is theirs, I will tell
15838	them about her. I will sing to them of Siri.
15839	The cascade of light from the distant space battle continued.
15840	There was no sound except for the slide of wind across escarpments. The
15841	group sat close together, leaning forward and looking at the antique
15842	comlog as if expecting more.
15843	There was no more. The Consul removed the micro-disk and pocketed it.
15844	Sol Weintraub rubbed the back of his sleeping infant and spoke to the
15845	Consul. 'Surely you!re not Merin Aspic."
15846	'No,' said the Consul. 'Merin Aspic died during the Rebellion. Siri's
15847	Rebellion."
15848	'How did you come to possess this recording?" asked Father Hoyt. Through
15849	the priest's mask of pain, it was visible that he had been moved. 'This
15850	incredible recording..."
15851	'He gave it to me,' said the Consul. 'A few weeks before he was killed
15852	in the Battle of the Archipelago." The Consul looked at the
15853	uncomprehending faces before him. 'I'm their grandson,' he said.
15854	'Siri's and Merin's.
15855	My father ... the Donel whom Aspic mentions ...
15856	became the first Home Rule Councilor when Maui-Covenant was admitted to
15857	the Protectorate. Later he was elected Senator and served until his
15858	death. I was nine years old that day on the hill near Siri's tomb. I
15859	was twenty - old enough to join the rebels and fight -- when Aspic came
15860	to our isle at night, took me aside, and forbade me to join their band."
15861	'Would you have fought?" asked Brawne Lamia.
15862	'Oh, yes. And died. Like a third of our menfolk and a fifth of our
15863	women. Like all of the dolphins and many of the isles themselves,
15864	although the Hegemony tried to keep as many of those intact as
15865	possible."
15866	'It is a moving document,' said Sol Weintraub. 'But why are you here?
15867	Why the pilgrimage to the Shrike?"
15868	'I am not finished,' said the Consul. 'Listen."
15869	My father was as weak as my grandmother had been strong. The Hegemony
15870	did not wait eleven local years to return - the FORCE torchships were in
15871	orbit before five years had elapsed. Father watched as the rebels'
15872	hastily constructed ships were swatted aside. He continued to defend
15873	the Hegemony as they laid siege to our world. I remember when I was
15874	fifteen, watching with my family from the upper deck of our ancestral
15875	isle as a dozen other islands burned in the distance, the Hegemony
15876	skimmers lighting the sea with their depth charges. In the morning, the
15877	waves were gray with the bodies of the dead dolphins.
15878	My older sister Lira went to fight with the rebels in those hopeless
15879	days after the Battle of the Archipelago.
15880	Eyewitnesses saw her die. Her body was never recovered.
15881	My father never mentioned her name again.
15882	Within three years after the cease-fire and admission to the
15883	Protectorate, we original colonists were a minority on our own world.
15884	The isles were tamed and said to tourists, just as Merin had predicted
15885	to Siri. Firstsite is a city of eleven million now, the condos and
15886	spires and EM cities extending around the entire island along the coast.
15887	Firstsite Harbor remains as a quaint bazaar, with descendants of the
15888	First Families selling crafts and overpriced art there.
15889	We lived on Tau Ceti Center for a while when Father was first elected
15890	Senator, and I finished school there. I was the dutiful son, extolling
15891	the virtues of life in the Web, studying the glorious history of the
15892	Hegemony of Man, andpreparing for my own career in the diplomatic corps.
15893	And all the time I waited.
15894	I returned to Maul-Covenant briefly after graduation, working in the
15895	offices on Central Administration Isle.
15896	Part of my job was to visit the hundreds of drilling platforms going up
15897	in the shallows, to report on the rapidly multiplying undersea
15898	complexes, and to act as liaison with the development corporations
15899	coming in from TC and Sol Draconi Septem. I did not enjoy the work. But
15900	I was efficient. And I smiled. And I waited.
15901	I courted and married a girl from one of the First
15902	Families, from Siri's cousin Bertol's line, and after receiving a rare
15903	'First' on diplomatic corps examinations, I requested a post out of the
15904	Web.
15905	Thus began our personal Diaspora, Gresha's and mine. I was efficient. I
15906	was born to diplomacy. Within .five standard years I was an Under
15907	Consul. Within eight, a Consul in my own right. As long as I stayed in
15908	the Outback, this was as far as I would rise.
15909	It was my choice. I worked for the Hegemony. And I waited.
15910	At first my role was to provide Web ingenuity to help the colonists do
15911	what they do best - destroy truly indigenous life. It is no. accident
15912	that in six centuries of interstellar expansion the Hegemony has
15913	encountered no species considered intelligent on the Drake- Turing-Chen
15914	Index. On Old Earth, it had long been accepted that if a species put
15915	mankind on itsfood-chain menu the species would be extinct before long.
15916	As the Web expanded, if a species attempted serious competition with
15917	humanity's intellect, that species wouM be extinct before the first
15918	farcaster opened in-system.
15919	On Whirl we stalked the elusive zeplen through their cloud towers. It
15920	is possible that they were not sapient by human or Core standards. But
15921	they were beautiful.
15922	When they died, rippling in rainbow colors, their many-hued messages
15923	unseen, unheard by their fleeing herdmates, the beauty of their death
15924	agony was beyond words. We sam their photoreceptive skins to Web
15925	corporations, their flesh to worlds like Heaven's Gate, and ground their
15926	bones to powder to sell as aphrodisiacs to the impotent and
15927	superstitious on a score of other colony worlds.
15928	On Garden I was adviser to the arcology engineers who drained Grand Fen,
15929	ending the short reign of the marsh centaurs who had ruled- and
15930	threatened Hegemony progress - there. They tried to migrate in the end,
15931	but the North Reaches were far too dry and when I visited the region
15932	decades later, when Garden entered the Web, the desiccated remains of
15933	the centaurs still littered some of the distant Reaches like the husks
15934	of exotic plants from some more colorful era.
15935	On Hebron I arrived just as the Jewish settlers were ending their long
15936	feud with the Seneschal Aluit, creatures as fragile as the world's
15937	waterless ecology. The Aluit were empathic and it was our fear and
15938	greed which killed them - that and our unbreachable alienness. But on
15939	Hebron it was not the death of the Aluit which turned my heart to stone,
15940	but my part in dooming the colonists themselves.
15941	On Old Earth they had a word for what I was-quisling.
15942	For, although Hebron was not my world, the settlers who had fled there
15943	had done so for reasons as clear as those of my ancestors who signed the
15944	Covenant of Life on the Old Earth island of MauL But I was waiting. And
15945	in my waiting I acted... in all senses of the word.
15946	They trusted me. They grew to believe in my candid revelations of how
15947	wonderful it was to rejoin the community of mankind... to join the Web.
15948	They insisted that only the one city might be open to foreigners. I
15949	smiled and agreed. And now New Jerusalem holds sixty millions while the
15950	continent holds ten million Jewish indigenies, dependent upon the Web
15951	city for most of what they need. Another decade. Perhaps less.
15952	I broke down a bit after Hebron was opened to the Web. I discovered
15953	alcohol, the blessed antithesis of Flashback and wireheading. Gresha
15954	stayed with me in the hospital there until I dried out. Oddly, for a
15955	Jewish world, the clinic was Catholic. I remember the rustle of robes
15956	in the halls at night.
15957	My breakdown had been very quiet and very far away.
15958	My career was not damaged. As full Consul, I took my wife and son to
15959	Bressia.
15960	How delicate our role there! How Byzantine the fine line we walked. For
15961	decades, Colonel Kassad, forces of the TechnoCore had been harassing the
15962	Ouster swarms wherever they fled. Now the forces-that-be in the Senate
15963	and AI Advisory Council had determined that some test had to be made of
15964	Ouster might in the Outback itself.
15965	Bressia was chosen. I admit, the Bressians had been our surrogates for
15966	decades before I arrived. Their society.
15967	was archaically and delightfully Prussian, militaristic to a fault,
15968	arrogant in their economic pretensions, xenophobic to the point of
15969	happily enlisting to wipe out the 'Ouster Menace." A t first, a few
15970	lend-lease torchships so that they could reach the swarms. Plasma
15971	weapons.
15972	Impact probes with tailored viruses.
15973	It was a slight miscalculation that I was still on Bressia when the
15974	Ouster hordes arrived. A few months' difference.
15975	A military-political analysis team should have been there in my place.
15976	It did not matter. Hegemony purposes were served.
15977	The resolve and rapid-deployment capabilities of FORCE were properly
15978	tested where no real harm was done to Hegemony interests. Gresha died,
15979	of course. In the first bombardment. And A!On, my ten-year-old son.
15980	He had been with me... had survived the war itself...
15981	only to die when some FORCE idiot set off a booby trap or demolition
15982	charge too near the refugee barracks in Buckminster, the capital.
15983	I was not with him when he died.
15984	I was promoted after Bressia. I was given the most challenging and
15985	sensitive assignment ever relegated to someone of mere consular rank:
15986	diplomat in charge of direct negotiations with the Ousters themselves.
15987	First I was 'cast to Tau Ceti Center for long conferences with Senator
15988	Gladstone's committee and some of the AI Councilors. I met with
15989	Gladstone herself. The plan was very complicated. Essentially the
15990	Ousters had to be provoked into attacking, and the key to that
15991	provocation was the world of Hyperion.
15992	The Ousters had been observing Hyperion since before the Battle of
15993	Bressia. Our intelligence suggested that they were obsessed with the
15994	Time Tombs and the Shrike. Their attack on the Hegemony hospital ship
15995	carrying Colonel Kassad, among others, had been a miscalculation; their
15996	ship captain had panicked when the hospital ship had been mistakenly
15997	identified as a military spinship. Worse, from the Ousters' point of
15998	view, was the fact that by setting their dropships down near the Tombs
15999	themselves, the same commander had revealed their ability to defy the
16000	time tides. After the Shrike had
16001	decimated their commando teams, the torchship captain returned to the
16002	Swarm to be executed.
16003	But our intelligence suggested that the Ouster miscalculation had not
16004	been a total disaster. Valuable information had been obtained about the
16005	Shrike. And their obsession with Hyperion had deepened.
16006	Gladstone explained to me how the Hegemony planned to capitalize on that
16007	obsession.
16008	The essence of the plan was that the Ousters had to be provoked into
16009	attacking the Hegemony. The focus of that attack was to be Hyperion
16010	itself. I was made to understand that the resulting battle had more to
16011	do with internal Web politics than with the Ousters. Elements of the
16012	TechnoCore had opposed Hyperion's entry into the Hegemony for centuries.
16013	Gladstone explained that this was no longer in the interest of humanity
16014	and that a forcible annexation of Hyperion - under the guise of
16015	defending the Web itself- would allow more progressive Al coalitions in
16016	the Core to gain power. This shift of the power balance in the Core
16017	would benefit the Senate and the Web in ways not fully explained to me.
16018	The Ousters would be eradicated as a potential menace once and for all.
16019	A new era of Hegemony glory would begin.
16020	Gladstone explained that I need not volunteer, that the mission would be
16021	fraught with dangers - both for my career and my life. I accepted
16022	anyway.
16023	The Hegemony provided me with a private spacecraft.
16024	I asked for only one modification: the addition of an an tique Stein way
16025	piano.
16026	For months I traveled alone under Hawking drive. For more months I
16027	wandered in regions where the Ouster Swarms regularly migrated.
16028	Eventually my ship was sensed and seized. They accepted that I was a
16029	courier and knew that I was a spy. They debated killing me and did not.
16030	They debated negotiating with me and eventually decided to do so.
16031	I will not try to describe the beauty of life in a Swarm - their
16032	zero-gravity globe cities and comet farms and thrust clusters, their
16033	micro-orbital forests and migrating rivers and the ten thousand colors
16034	and textures of life at Rendezvous Week. Suffice it to say that I
16035	believe the Ousters have done what Web humanity has not in the past
16036	millennia: evolved. While we llve in our derivative cultures, pale
16037	reflections of Old Earth life, the Ousters have explored new dimensions
16038	of aesthetics and ethics and biosciences and art and all the things that
16039	must change and grow to reflect the human soul.
16040	Barbarians, we call them, while all the while we timidly cling to our
16041	Web like Visigoths crouching in the ruins of Rome's faded glory and
16042	proclaim ourselves civilized.
16043	Within ten standard months, I had told them my greatest secret and they
16044	had told me theirs. I explained in all the detail I could what plans
16045	for extinction had been laid for them by Gladstone's people. I told
16046	them what little the Web scientists understood of the ttnomaly of the
16047	Time Tombs and revealed the TechnoCore's inexplicable fear of Hyperion.
16048	I described how Hyperion would be a trap for them if they dared attempt
16049	to occupy it, how every element of FORCE would be brought to Hyperion
16050	System to crush them. I revealed everything I knew and waited once
16051	again to die.
16052	Instead of killing me, they told me something. They showed me fatline
16053	intercepts, tightbeam recordings, and their own records from the date
16054	they fled Old Earth System, four and a half centuries earlier. Their
16055	facts were terrible and simple.
16056	The Big Mistake of '38 had been no mistake. The death of Old Earth had
16057	been deliberate, planned by elements of the TechnoCore and their human
16058	counterparts in the fledgling government of the Hegemony. The Hegira
16059	had been planned in detail decades before the runaway black hole had
16060	'accidentally' been plunged into the heart of Old Earth.
16061	The Worldweb, the All Thing, the Hegemony of Man - allof them had been
16062	built on the most vicious type of patricide. Now they were being
16063	maintained by a quiet and deliberate policy of fraticide - the murder of
16064	any species with even the slightest potential of being a competitor.
16065	And the Ousters, the only other tribe of humanity free to wander between
16066	the stars and the only group not dominated by the TechnoCore, was next
16067	on our list of extinction.
16068	I returned to the Web. Over thirty years of Web-time had passed. Meina
16069	Gladstone was CEO. Siri's Rebellion was a romantic legend, a minor
16070	footnote in the history of the Hegemony.
16071	I met with Gladstone. I told her many - but not all -of the things the
16072	Ousters had revealed. I told her that they knew that any battle for
16073	Hyperion would be a trap, but that they were coming anyway. I told her
16074	that the Ousters wanted me to become Consul on Hyperion so that I might
16075	be a double agent when war came.
16076	I did not tell her that they had promised to give me a device which
16077	would open the Time Tombs and allow the Shrike free rein.,
16078	CEO Gladstone had long talks with me. FORCE: Intelligence agents had
16079	even longer talks with me, some lasting months. Technologies and drugs
16080	were used to confirm that I was telling the truth and keeping nothing
16081	back. The Ousters also had been very good with technologies and drugs.
16082	I was telling the truth. I was also keeping something back.
16083	In the end, I was assigned to Hyperion. Gladstone offered to raise the
16084	world to Protectorate status and me to an ambassadorship. I declined
16085	both offers, although I asked if I could keep my private spacecraft. I
16086	arrived on a regularly scheduled spinship, and my own ship arrived
16087	several weeks later in the belly of a visiting torchship. It was left
16088	in a parking orbit with the understanding that I could summon it and
16089	leave any time I wished.
16090	Alone on Hyperion, I waited. Years passed. I allowed my aide to govern
16091	the Outback world while I drank at Cicero's and waited.
16092	The Ousters contacted me through private fatline and I took a three
16093	weeks' leave from the Consulate, brought my ship down to an isolated
16094	place near the Sea of Grass, rendezvoused with their scoutship near the
16095	OOrt Cloud, picked up their agent - a woman named Andil - and a trio of
16096	technicians, and dropped down north of the Bridle Range, a few
16097	kilometers from the Tombs themselves.
16098	The Ousters did not have farcasters. They spent their lives on the long
16099	marches between the stars, watching life in the Web speed by like some
16100	film or holie set at a frenzied speed. They were obsessed with time.
16101	The TechnoCore had given the Hegemony the farcaster and continued to
16102	maintain it. No human scientists or team of human scientists had come
16103	close to understanding it. The Ousters tried. They failed. But even
16104	in their failures they made inroads into understanding the manipulation
16105	of space/time.
16106	They understood the time tides, the anti-entropic fields surrounding the
16107	Tombs. They could not generate such fields, but they could shield
16108	against them and-theoretically - collapse them. The Time Tombs and all
16109	their contents would cease to age backward. The Tombs would 'open. '
16110	The Shrike would slip its tether, no longer connected to the vicinity of
16111	the Tombs. Whatever else was inside would now be freed.
16112	The Ousters believed that the Time Tombs were artifacts from their
16113	future, the Shrike a weapon of redemption awaiting the proper hand to
16114	seize it. The Shrike Cult saw the monster as an avenging angel; the
16115	Ousters saw it as a tool of human devising, sent back through time to
16116	deliver humanity from the TechnoCore. Andil and the technicians were
16117	there to calibrate and experiment.
16118	'You won't use it now?" I asked. We were standing in the shadow of the
16119	structure called the Sphinx.
16120	'Not now,' said Andil. 'When the invasion is imminent."
16121	'But you said it would take months for the device to work,' I said, for
16122	the Tombs to open."
16123	Andil nodded. Her eyes were a dark green. She was very tall, and I
16124	could make out the subtle stripes of the powered exoskeleton on her
16125	skinsuit. 'Perhaps a year or longer,' she said. 'The device causes the
16126	anti-entropic field to decay slowly. But once begun, the process is
16127	irrevocable. But we will not activate it until the Ten Councils have
16128	decided that invasion of the Web is necessary. '
16129	'There are doubts?" I said.
16130	'Ethical debates,' said A ndii. A few meters from us, the three
16131	technicians were covering the device with chameleon cloth and a coded
16132	containment field. 'And interstellar war will cause the deaths of
16133	millions, perhaps
16134	billions. Releasing the Shrike into the Web will have unforeseen
16135	consequences. As much as we need to strike at the Core, there are
16136	debates as to which is the best way. '
16137	I nodded and looked at the device and the valley of the Tombs. 'But
16138	once this is activated,' I said, 'there is no turning back. The Shrike
16139	will be released, and you will
16140	have to have won the war to control it?"
16141	Andil smiled slightly. 'That is true."
16142	I shot her then, her and then the three technicians.
16143	Then I tossed Grandmother Siri's Steiner-Ginn laser far into the drift
16144	dunes and sat on an empty flowfoam crate and sobbed for several minutes.
16145	Then I walked over, used a techniciqn's cornlog to enter the containment
16146	field, threw off the chameleon cloth, and triggered the device.
16147	There was no immediate change. The air held the same rich, late-winter
16148	light. The Jade Tomb glowed softly while the Sphinx continued to stare
16149	down at nothing.
16150	The only sound was the rasp of sand across the crates and bodies. Only
16151	a glowing indicator on the Ouster device showed that it was working ...
16152	had already worked.
16153	I walked slowly back to the ship, half expecting the Shrike to appear,
16154	half hoping that it would. I sat on the balcony of my ship for more
16155	than an hour, watching the shadows filling the valley and the sand
16156	covering the distant corpses. There was no Shrike. No thorn tree.
16157	After a while I played a Bach Prelude on the Steinway, buttoned up the
16158	ship, and rose into space.
16159	I contacted the Ouster ship and said that there had been an accident.
16160	The Shrike had taken the others; the device had been activated
16161	prematurely. Even in their confusion and panic, the Ousters offered me
16162	refuge. I declined the offer and turned my ship toward the Web.
16163	The Ousters did not pursue.
16164	I used myfatline transmitter to contact Gladstone and to tell her that
16165	the Ouster agents had been eliminated. !
16166	told her that the invasion was very likely, that the trap would be
16167	sprung as planned. I did not tell her about the device. Gladstone
16168	congratulated me and called me home. I declined. I told her that I
16169	needed silence and solitude. I turned my ship toward the Outback world
16170	nearest the Hyperion system, knowing that travel itself would eat time
16171	until the next act commenced.
16172	Later, when the fatline call to pilgrimage came from Gladstone herself,
16173	I knew the role the Ousters had planned for me in these final days: the
16174	Ousters, or the Core, or Gladstone and her machinations. It no longer
16175	matters who consider themselves the masters of events.
16176	Events no longer obey their masters.
16177	The world as we know it is ending, my friends, no matter what happens to
16178	us. As for me, I have no request of the Shrike. I bring no final words
16179	for it or the universe.
16180	I have returned because I must, because this is my fate. I've known
16181	what I must do since I was a child, returning alone to Siri's tomb and
16182	swearing vengeance on the Hegemony. I've known what price I must pay,
16183	both in life and in history.
16184	But when the time comes to judge, to understand a betrayal which will
16185	spread like fame across the Web, which will end worlds, l ask you not to
16186	think of me - my name was not even writ on water as your lost poet's
16187	soul said - but to think of Old Earth dying for no reason, to think of
16188	the dolphins, their gray flesh drying and rotting in the sun, to see -
16189	as I have seen - the motile isles with no place to wander, their feeding
16190	grounds destroyed, the Equatorial Shallows scabbed with drilling
16191	platforms, the islands themselves burdened with shouting, trammeling
16192	tourists smelling of UV lotion and cannabis.
16193	Or better yet, think of none of that. Stand as l did after throwing the
16194	switch, a murderer, a betrayer, but still proud, feet firmly planted on
16195	Hyperion's shifting sand, head held high, fist raised against the sky,
16196	crying 'A plague on both your houses.t'
16197	For you see, I remember my grandmother's dream. I remember the way it
16198	could have been.
16199	I remember Siri.
16200	'Are you the spy?" asked Father Hoyt. 'The Ouster spy?"
16201	The Consul rubbed his cheeks and said nothing. He looked tired, spent.
16202	'Yeah,' said Martin Silenus. 'CEO Gladstone warned
16203	me when I was chosen for the pilgrimage. She said that there was a
16204	spy."
16205	'She told all of us,' snapped Brawne Lamia. She stared at the Consul.
16206	Her gaze seemed sad.
16207	'Our friend is a spy,' said Sol Weintraub, 'but not merely an Ouster
16208	spy." The baby had awakened.
16209	Weintraub lifted her to calm her crying. 'He is what they call in the
16210	thrillers a double agent, a triple agent in this case, an agent to
16211	infinite regression. In truth, an agent of retribution."
16212	The Consul looked at the old scholar.
16213	'He's still a spy,' said Silenus. 'Spies are executed, aren't they?" ,
16214	Colonel Kassad had the deathwand in his hand. It was not aimed in
16215	anyone's direction. 'Are you in touch with
16216	your ship?" he asked the Consul.
16217	'Yes." 'How?"
16218	'Through Siri's comlog. It was... modified."
16219	Kassad nodded slightly. 'And you've been in touch
16220	with the Ousters via the ship's fatline transmitter?" 'Yes."
16221	'Making reports on the pilgrimage as they expected?" 'Yes."
16222	'Have they replied?"
16223	'No."
16224	'How can we believe him?" cried the poet. 'He's a fucking spy."
16225	'Shut up,' Colonel Kassad said flatly, finally. His gaze never left the
16226	Consul. 'Did you attack Her Masteen?"
16227	'No,' said the Consul. 'But when the Yggdrasili
16228	burned, I knew that something was wrong."
16229	'What do you mean?" said Kassad.
16230	The Consul cleared his throat. 'I've spent time with Templar Voices of
16231	the Tree. Their connection to their treeships is almost telepathic.
16232	Masteen's reaction was far too subdued. Either he wasn't what he said
16233	he was, or he had known that the ship was to be destroyed and had
16234	severed contact with it. When I was on guard duty, I went below to
16235	confront him. He was gone. The cabin was as we found it, except for
16236	the fact that the MObius cube was in a neutral state. The erg could
16237	have escaped. I secured it and went above."
16238	'You did not harm Het Masteen?" Kassad asked again.
16239	'No."
16240	'I repeat, why the fuck should we believe you?" said Silenus. The poet
16241	was drinking Scotch from the last bottle he had brought along.
16242	The Consul looked at the bottle as he answered. 'You have no reason to
16243	believe me. It doesn't matter."
16244	Colonel Kassad's long fingers idly tapped the dull casing of the
16245	deathwand. 'What will you do with your fatline commlink now?"
16246	The Consul took a tired breath. 'Report when the Time Tombs open. If
16247	I'm still alive then."
16248	Brawne Lamia pointed at the antique comlog. 'We could destroy it."
16249	The Consul shrugged.
16250	'It could be of use,' said the Colonel. 'We can eavesdrop on military
16251	and civilian transmissions made in the clear. If we have to, we can
16252	call the Consul's ship."
16253	'No!" cried the Consul. It was the first time he had shown emotion in
16254	many minutes. 'We can't turn back now."
16255	'l believe we have no intention of turning back,' said Colonel Kassad.
16256	He looked around at pale faces. No one spoke for a moment.
16257	'There is a decision we have to make,' said Sol Weintraub. He rocked
16258	his infant and nodded in the direction of the Consul.
16259	Martin Silenus had been resting his forehead on the mouth of the empty
16260	bottle of Scotch. He looked up. 'The penalty for treason is death." He
16261	giggled. 'We're all going to die within a few hours anyway. Why not
16262	make our last act an execution?"
16263	Father Hoyt grimaced as a spasm of pain gripped him.
16264	He touched his cracked lips with a trembling finger.
16265	'We're not a court."
16266	'Yes,' said Colonel Kassad, 'we are."
16267	The Consul drew up his legs, rested his forearms on his knees, and laced
16268	his fingers. 'Decide then." There was no emotion in his voice.
16269	Brawne Lamia had brought out her father's automatic pistol. Now she set
16270	it on the floor near where she sat. Her eyes darted from the Consul to
16271	Kassad. 'We're talking treason here?" she said. 'Treason toward what?
16272	None of us except maybe the Colonel there is exactly a leading citizen.
16273	We've all been kicked around by forces beyond our control."
16274	Sol Weintraub spoke directly to the Consul. 'What you have ignored, my
16275	friend, is that if Meina Gladstone and elements of the Core chose you
16276	for the Ouster contact, they knew very well what you would do. Perhaps
16277	they could not have guessed that the Ousters had the means by which o
16278	open the Tombs - although with the Als of the Core one can never know -
16279	but they certainly knew that you would turn on both societies, both
16280	camps which have injured your family. It is all part of some bizarre
16281	plan. You were no more an instrument of your own will than was' - he
16282	held the baby up - 'this child."
16283	The Consul looked confused. He started to speak, shook his head
16284	instead.
16285	'That may be correct,' said Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, 'but however they
16286	may try to use all of us as pawns, we must attempt to choose our own
16287	actions." He glanced up at the wall where pulses of light from the
16288	distant space battle painted the plaster blood red. 'Because of this
16289	war, thousands will die. Perhaps millions. If the Ousters or the
16290	Shrike gain access to the Web's farcaster system, billions of lives on
16291	hundreds of worlds are at risk."
16292	The Consul watched as Kassad raised the deathwand.
16293	'This would be faster for all of us,' said Kassad. 'The Shrike knows no
16294	mercy."
16295	No one spoke. The Consul seemed to be staring at something at a great
16296	distance.
16297	Kassad pressed on the safety and set the wand back in his belt. 'We've
16298	come this far,' he said. 'We will go the rest of the way together."
16299	Brawne Lamia put away her father's pistol, rose, crossed the small
16300	space, knelt next to the Consul, and put her arms around him. Startled,
16301	the Consul raised one arm. Light danced on the wall behind them.
16302	A moment later, Sol Weintraub came close and
16303	hugged them both with one arm around their shoulders.
16304	The baby wriggled in pleasure at the sudden warmth of bodies. The
16305	Consul smelled the talc-and-newborn scent of her.
16306	'I was wrong,' said the Consul. 'I will make a reqtlest of the Shrike.
16307	I will ask for her." He gently touched Rachel's head where the small
16308	skull curved in to neck.
16309	Martin Silenus made a noise which began as a laugh and died as a sob.
16310	'Our last requests,' he said. 'Does the muse grant requests? I have no
16311	request. I want only for the poem to be finished."
16312	Father Hoyt turned toward the poet. 'Is it so important?"
16313	'Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes,' gasped Silenus. He dropped the empty Scotch
16314	bottle, reached into his bag, and lifted out a handful of flimsies,
16315	holding them high as if offering them to the group. 'Do you want to
16316	read it? Do you want me to read it to you? It's flowing again. Read
16317	the old parts. Read the Cantos I wrote three centuries ago and never
16318	published. It's all here. We're all here. My name, yours, this trip.
16319	Don't you see... I'm not creating a poem, I'm creating the future!" He
16320	let the flimsies fall, raised the empty bottle, frowned, and held it
16321	like a chalice. 'I'm creating the future,' he repeated without looking
16322	up, 'but it's the past which must be changed.
16323	One instant. One decision."
16324	Martin Silenus raised his face. His eyes were red. 'This thing that is
16325	going to kill us tomorrow - my muse, our maker, our unmaker - it's
16326	traveled back through time.
16327	Well, let it. This time, let it take me and leave Billy alone.
16328	Let it take me and let the poem end there, unfinished for all time." He
16329	raised the bottle higher, closed his eyes, and threw it against the far
16330	wall. Glass shards reflected orange light from the silent explosions.
16331	Colonel Kassad stepped closer and laid long fingers on the poet's
16332	shoulder.
16333	For a few seconds the room seemed warmed by the mere fact of human
16334	contact. Father Lenar Hoyt stepped away from the wall where he had been
16335	leaning, raised his right hand with thumb and little finger touching,
16336	three fingers raised, the gesture somehow including himself as
16337	well as those before him, and said softly, 'Ego te absolvo. '
16338	Wind scraped at the outer walls and whistled around the gargoyles and
16339	balconies. Light from a battle a hundred million kilometers away
16340	painted the group in blood hues.
16341	Colonel Kassad walked to the doorway. The group moved apart.
16342	'Let's try to get some sleep,' said Brawne Lamia.
16343	Later, alone in his bedroll, listening to the wind shriek and howl, the
16344	Consul set his cheek against his pack and pulled the rough blanket
16345	higher. It had been years since he had been able to fall asleep easily.
16346	The Consul se[ his curled fist against his cheek, closed his eyes, and
16347	slept.
16348	EPILOGUE
16349	The Consul awoke to the sound 'of a balalaika being played so softly
16350	that at first he thought it was an undercurrent of his dream.
16351	The Consul rose, shivered in the cold air, wrapped his blanket around
16352	him, and went out onto the long balcony.
16353	It was not yet dawn. The skies still burned with the light of battle.
16354	'I'm sorry,' said Lenar Hoyt, looking up from his instrument. The
16355	priest was huddled deep in his cape.
16356	'It's all right,' said the Consul. 'I was ready to awaken." It was
16357	true. He could not remember feeling more rested. 'Please continue,' he
16358	said. The notes were sharp and clear but barely audible above the wind
16359	noise. It was as if Hoyt was playing a duet with the cold wind from the
16360	peaks above. The Consul found the clarity almost painful.
16361	Brawne Lamia and Colonel Kassad came out. A minute later Sol Weintraub
16362	joined them. Rachel twisted in his arms, reaching toward the night sky
16363	as if she could grasp the bright blossoms there.
16364	Hoyt played. The wind was rising in the hour before dawn, and the
16365	gargoyles and escarpments acted' like reeds to the Keep's cold bassoon.
16366	Martin Silenus emerged, holding his head. 'No fucking respect for a
16367	hangover,' he said. He leaned on the broad railing. 'If I barf from
16368	this height, it'll be half an hour before the vomitus lands."
16369	Father Hoyt did not look up. His fingers flew across the strings of the
16370	small instrument. The northwest wind grew stronger and colder and the
16371	balalaika played
16372	counterpart, its notes warm and alive. The Consul and the others
16373	huddled in blankets and capes as the breeze grew to a torrent and the
16374	unnamed music kept pace with it. It was the strangest and most
16375	beautiful symphony the Consul had ever heard.
16376	The wind gusted, roared, peaked, and died. Hoyt ended his tune.
16377	Brawne Lamia looked around. 'It's almost dawn." 'We have another hour,'
16378	said Colonel Kassad.
16379	Lamia shrugged. 'Why walt?"
16380	'Why indeed?" said Sol Weintraub. He looked to the east where the only
16381	hint of sunrise was the faintest of palings in constellations there. 'It
16382	looks like a good day is coming."
16383	'Let's get ready,' said Hoyt. 'Do we need our luggage?"
16384	The group looked at one another.
16385	'No, I think not,' said the Consul. 'The Colonel will bring the comlog
16386	with the fatline communicator.
16387	Bring anything necessary for your audience with the Shrike. We'll leave
16388	the rest of the stuff here."
16389	'All right,' said Brawne Lamia, turning back from the dark doorway,
16390	gesturing toward the others, 'let's do it."
16391	There were six hundred and sixty-one steps from the northeast portal of
16392	the Keep to the moor below. There were no railings. The group
16393	descended carefully, watching their step in the insecure light.
16394	Once onto the valley floor, they looked back at the outcrop of stone
16395	above. Chronos Keep looked like part of the mountain, its balconies and
16396	external stairways mere slashes in the rock. Occasionally a brighter
16397	explosion would illuminate a window or throw a gargoyle shadow, but
16398	except for those instances it was as if the Keep had vanished behind
16399	them.
16400	They crossed the low hills below the Keep, staying on grass and avoiding
16401	the sharp shrubs which extended thorns like claws. In ten minutes they
16402	had crossed to sand and were descending low dunes toward the valley.
16403	Brawne Lamia led the group. She wore her finest cape and a red silk
16404	suit with black trim. Her cornlog gleamed on her wrist. Colonel Kassad
16405	came next. He was in full battle armor, camouflage polymer not yet
16406	activated so the suit looked matte black, absorbing even the light from
16407	above. Kassad carried a standard-issue FORCE assault rifle. His visor
16408	gleamed like a black mirror.
16409	Father Hoyt wore his black cape, black suit, and clerical collar. The
16410	balalaika was cradled in his arms like a child. He continued to set his
16411	feet carefully, as if each step caused pain. The Consul followed. He
16412	was dressed in his diplomatic best, starched blouse, formal black
16413	trousers and demi-jacket, velvet cape, and the gold tricome he had worn
16414	the first day on the treeship.
16415	He had to keep a grip on the hat against the wind that had come up
16416	again, hurling grains of sand in his face and sliding across the dune
16417	tops like a serpent. Martin Silenus followed close behind in his coat
16418	of wind-rippled fur.
16419	So! Weintraub brought up the rear. Rachel rode in the infant carrier,
16420	nestled under the cape and coat against her father's chest. Weintraub
16421	was singing a low tune to her, the notes lost in the breeze.
16422	Forty minutes out and they had come even with the dead city. Marble and
16423	granite gleamed in the violet light. The peaks glowed behind them, the
16424	Keep indistinguishable from the other mountain-sides. The group crossed
16425	a sandy vale, climbed a low dune, and suddenly the head of the valley of
16426	the Time Tombs was visible for the first time. The Consul could make
16427	out the thrust of the Sphinx's wings and a glow of jade.
16428	A rumble and crash from far behind them made the Consul turn, startled,
16429	his heart pounding.
16430	'Isn't it beginning?" asked Lamia. 'The bombardment?" 'No, look,' said
16431	Kassad. He pointed to a point above
16432	the mountain peaks where blackness obliterated the stars. Lightning
16433	exploded along the false horizon, illuminating icefields and glaciers.
16434	'Only a storm,' he said.
16435	They resumed their trek across vermilion sands. The Consul found
16436	himself straining to make out the shape of a figure near the Tombs or at
16437	the head of the valley. He was certain beyond all certainty that
16438	something awaited them there . . . that it
16439	awaited.
16440	'Look at that,' said Brawne Lamia, her whisper almost lost in the wind.
16441	The Time Tombs were glowing. What the Consul had first taken to be
16442	light reflected from above was not.
16443	Each Tomb glowed a different hue and each was clearly visible now, the
16444	glow brightening, the Tombs receding far back into the darkness of the
16445	valley. The air smelled of ozone.
16446	'Is that a common phenomenon?" asked Father Hoyt, his voice thin.
16447	The Consul shook his head. 'l've never heard of it." 'It had never been
16448	reported at the time Rachel came to study the Tombs,' said Sol
16449	Weintraub. He began to hum the low tune as the group started forward
16450	again through shifting sands.
16451	They paused at the head of the valley. Soft dunes gave way to rock and
16452	ink-black shadows at the swale which led down to the glowing Tombs. No
16453	one led the way. No one pokc. The Consul felt his heart beating wildly
16454	against his ribs. Worse than fear or knowledge of what lay below was
16455	the blackness of spirit which seemed to have come into him on the wind,
16456	chilling him and making him want to run screaming toward the hills from
16457	which they had come.
16458	The Consul turned to Sol Weintraub. 'What's that tune you're singing to
16459	Rachel?"
16460	The scholar forced a grin and scratched his short beard. 'It's from an
16461	ancient flat film. Pre-Hegira. Hell, it's pre-everything."
16462	'Let's hear it,' said Brawne Lamia, understand ing what the Consul was
16463	doing. Her face was very pale.
16464	Weintraub sang it, his voice thin and barely audible at first. But the
16465	tune was forceful and oddly compelling.
16466	Father Hoyt uncradled the balalaika and played along, the notes gaining
16467	confidence.
16468	Brawne Lamia laughed. Martin Silenus said in awe, 'My God, I used to
16469	sing this in my childhood. It's ancient."
16470	'But who is the wizard?" asked Colonel Kassad, the amplified voice
16471	through his helmet oddly amusing in this context.
16472	'And what is Oz?" asked Lamia.
16473	'And just who is off to see this wizard?" asked the Consul, feeling the
16474	black panic in him fade ever so slightly.
16475	Sol Weintraub paused and tried to answer their questions, explaining the
16476	plot of a flat film which had been dust for centuries.
16477	'Never mind,' said Brawne Lamia. 'You can tell us later. Just sing it
16478	again."
16479	Behind them, the darkness had engulfed the mountains as the storm swept
16480	down and across the moors toward them. The sky continued to bleed light
16481	but now the eastern horizon had paled slightly more than the rest. The
16482	dead city glowed to their left like stone teeth.
16483	Brawne Lamia took the lead again. Sol Weintraub sang more loudly,
16484	Rachel wiggling in delight. Lenar Hoyt threw back his cape so as to
16485	better play the balalaika. Martin Silenus threw an empty bottle far out
16486	onto the sands and sang along, his deep voice surprisingly strong and
16487	pleasant above the wind.
16488	Fedmahn Kassad pushed up his visor, shouldered his weapon, and joined in
16489	the chorus. The Consul started to sing, thought about the absurd
16490	lyrics, laughed aloud, and started again.
16491	Just where the darkness began, the trail broadened.
16492	The Consul moved to his right, Kassad joining him, Sol Weintraub filling
16493	the gap, so that instead of a single-file
16494	procession, the six adults were walking abreast. Brawne Lamia took
16495	Silenus's hand in hers, joined hands with Sol on the other side.
16496	Still singing loudly, not looking back, matching stride for stride, they
16497	descended into the valley.
